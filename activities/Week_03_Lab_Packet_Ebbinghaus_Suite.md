**Name:** \writingline

\vspace{0.5cm}

## Overview

Today you will complete **two experiments** that investigate the relationship between **conscious perception** and **motor control**:

1. **Activity 1: Perception Task** - Does the illusion work?
2. **Activity 2: Fitts Tapping Task** - Does the illusion affect continuous movement?

**The Central Question:** If your brain builds a "mental picture" to guide both perception and action, and that picture is wrong (illusion), what happens when you try to act?

**Keep this packet throughout class.** You will use your observations during the discussion section.

\newpage

# ACTIVITY 1: Perception Task (Computerized Susceptibility Test)

**Reference:** Ebbinghaus (1902); Titchener (1901)

## 1) The Computerized Ebbinghaus Test

You will complete a **computerized susceptibility test** that measures how strongly the Ebbinghaus illusion affects your perception.

**The Test:**

- You will see multiple trials with two circles (left and right)
- Each circle may be surrounded by **small circles**, **large circles**, or **no circles**
- The central circles (orange/red) may be the same size or different sizes
- **Your task:** Judge which central circle appears **larger**
  - Press **F** if the left circle looks bigger
  - Press **J** if the right circle looks bigger
  - Press **Space** if they look equal

**At the end:** The computer will calculate your **Susceptibility Score** - the percentage of trials where the surrounding context (small vs. large inducers) influenced your judgment, even when the central circles were physically the same size.

## 2) Hypothesis (Before Taking the Test)

Before taking the test, make predictions:

**Personal Prediction:**

How susceptible do you think you will be to the illusion?

- [ ] Very susceptible (70-100% - the context will strongly fool me)
- [ ] Moderately susceptible (40-70% - the context will influence me sometimes)
- [ ] Minimally susceptible (10-40% - I'll mostly see the true sizes)
- [ ] Not susceptible (<10% - I won't be fooled)

**Why?** (What strategies might help you resist or succumb to the illusion?)

\writingline

\writingline

\writingline

**Class Prediction:**

What do you predict the **average class susceptibility score** will be?

Average class score: _________ %

**Why do you think this happens?** (What visual information might be causing the illusion?)

\writingline

\writingline

\writingline

## 3) Your Susceptibility Score (After Taking the Test)

After completing the computerized test, record your results:

**Your Susceptibility Score:** _________ %

**Trials influenced by context:** _______ / _______ applicable trials

**How does your score compare to your prediction?**

- [ ] Higher than expected (more susceptible than I thought)
- [ ] About what I expected
- [ ] Lower than expected (less susceptible than I thought)

**Observations about your experience:**

Were there any trials where you felt uncertain or surprised by your judgment?

\writingline

\writingline

What do you think was causing one circle to look larger than the other?

## 4) Class Data Collection

We will collect susceptibility scores from the entire class.

| Student           | Susceptibility Score (%) |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1                 |                          |
| 2                 |                          |
| 3                 |                          |
| 4                 |                          |
| 5                 |                          |
| **Class Average** |                          |

## 5) Reflection: What Does This Tell Us?

**Did the illusion work for most people?**

\writingline

\writingline

**Even when you KNEW the circles were sometimes the same size, why were you still influenced by the surrounding context?**

\writingline

\writingline

\writingline

**According to the "Standard Story" of perception, what would your brain have to do to create this perception?**

(Hint: Think about the steps - Sensation → Representation → Perception)

\writingline

\writingline

\writingline

## 6) The Puzzle: What About Action?

If your brain built an internal "mental image" of the circles, and that image shows one circle as larger (as evidenced by your susceptibility score)...

**What would happen if you tried to MOVE to tap on one of the circles repeatedly?**

**Your prediction:**

\writingline

\writingline

**Why?** (What information would your movement use?)

\writingline

\writingline

**Now move to Activity 2 to test your prediction.**

\newpage

# ACTIVITY 2: Oscillatory Fitts Task

**Reference:** Fitts (1954); Franz et al. (2000) - Planning vs. control dissociation

## 1) Setup: The Fitts Tapping Task

You will perform **rapid alternating movements** between two target circles under different Ebbinghaus context conditions.

**The Task:**

- Start with your finger/stylus on one target circle
- Move as quickly and accurately as possible to the other target circle
- Alternate back and forth between the two targets
- Complete **10 oscillations** (20 taps total: 10 on each target)

**Important:** In each condition, **BOTH targets have the SAME surrounding context** (not different).

**Three Context Conditions:**

- **Condition A (No Context):** Both targets are plain circles (no surrounding circles)
- **Condition B (Large Context):** Both targets surrounded by **large circles** (targets should look smaller)
- **Condition C (Small Context):** Both targets surrounded by **small circles** (targets should look larger)

**Two Size Blocks:**

- **Block 1:** Both targets are **2 cm** diameter
- **Block 2:** Both targets are **3 cm** diameter

**Reality:** The targets are the physical size they are! The surrounding context creates an illusion of size difference, but doesn't change the actual target dimensions.

## 2) Hypothesis

**From Activity 1, you know:** Targets surrounded by small circles **look larger** than targets surrounded by large circles.

Fitts' Law suggests that movement time and accuracy of tapping between targets is affected by target size, where smaller targets are likely to be more difficult to hit (show increased movement time and tapping errors).

**Question:** Will the surrounding context affect your movement performance?

**Formulate hypotheses for:**

### Movement Time (MT)

When tapping between two targets under different context conditions, my movement time will:

- [ ] Be **slowest** in Condition B (large context - targets look smaller/harder to hit)
- [ ] Be **slowest** in Condition C (small context - targets look larger/easier to hit)
- [ ] Be **fastest** in Condition A (no context - no illusion)
- [ ] Be **the same** across all conditions (context won't affect movement time)
- [ ] Something else: \writingline

**Why?** (What information controls your movement speed?)

\writingline

\writingline

### Accuracy (Errors)

When tapping under different context conditions, I will make:

- [ ] **More errors** in Condition B (large context - targets look smaller)
- [ ] **More errors** in Condition C (small context - targets look larger)
- [ ] **More errors** in Condition A (no context baseline)
- [ ] **Equal errors** across all conditions (context won't affect accuracy)
- [ ] Something else: \writingline

**Why?** (What information controls your movement accuracy?)

\writingline

\writingline

## 3) Procedure

**Materials:**

- Three sets of tapping surfaces, each with two targets separated by **15 cm** (center-to-center):
  - **Set A:** No surrounding circles (plain targets)
  - **Set B:** Both targets surrounded by large circles
  - **Set C:** Both targets surrounded by small circles
- Two target sizes: **2 cm** and **3 cm** diameter
- Stylus or finger for tapping
- Stopwatch

**Instructions:**

You will complete **6 conditions** (3 contexts × 2 sizes), with **3 trials per condition**:

1. **Block 1 (2 cm targets):**
   - Condition A (No Context): 3 trials
   - Condition B (Large Context): 3 trials
   - Condition C (Small Context): 3 trials

2. **Block 2 (3 cm targets):**
   - Condition A (No Context): 3 trials
   - Condition B (Large Context): 3 trials
   - Condition C (Small Context): 3 trials

**For each trial:**

1. **Starting Position:** Place your stylus/finger on left target.
2. **Command "Go!":** Begin alternating as quickly and accurately as possible.
3. **Complete 10 oscillations** (Left→Right→Left→Right... for a total of 20 taps).
4. **Partner Records:**
   - **Movement Time (MT):** Total time to complete 10 oscillations (use stopwatch)
   - **Errors:** Number of taps that **miss** the target circle (count only clear misses)

## 7) Reflection: Action vs. Perception

**Compare your findings across both activities:**

| Activity                              | Was the illusion present? | Did it affect performance? |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Activity 1: Perception (Judgment)** | Yes / No                  | N/A (perceptual judgment)  |
| **Activity 2: Fitts Tapping**         | N/A (action task)         | Yes / No                   |

**What pattern emerges?**

\writingline

\writingline

\writingline

\newpage

# FINAL SYNTHESIS

**Across both activities, reflect on what you've learned about the relationship between perception and action.**

## 1) The Puzzle: Why Doesn't the Illusion Affect Action?

**The Standard Story predicts:**

If your brain builds a **mental representation** where Target A looks smaller than Target B, then:

- Your hand should open less for Target A when grasping
- Your movements should be slower/less accurate when aiming for Target A

**But your data suggest:**

\writingline

\writingline

\writingline

## 2) Three Possible Explanations

**Explanation 1: Visual Perception**

Action uses the same information as conscious perception (predicts illusion affects action)

**Explanation 2: Two Visual Systems**

One system for perception (fooled by illusion), one for action (not fooled)

**Explanation 3: Task-Specific Information**

Different tasks detect different information sources

**Which explanation best fits your data?**

\writingline

\writingline

\writingline

## 3) Connecting to Theory

**The Standard Story would say:**

Your brain builds a **mental representation** of the target. If that representation is wrong (illusion), your movements should always be affected too.

**The Ecological Approach (Blau & Wagman) would say:**

Think about:

- What is the difference between **perceiving for judgment** vs. **perceiving for action**?
- Could your eyes and your movement system be detecting **different higher-order variables**?
- What information does the visual system detect for judgment vs. for guiding continuous action?

\writingline

\writingline

\writingline

## 4) Preview Question for Discussion

**Can we say the "hand is smarter" than the "eye"?**

Why or why not?

\writingline

\writingline

\writingline

## 5) Deep Question: What Information Guides Action?

**From your data, what can you conclude about:**

**The relationship between conscious perception and motor control:**

\writingline

\writingline

**The role of the Ebbinghaus context (surrounding circles) in guiding action:**

\writingline

\writingline

## 6) Extension: Fitts' Law

**Fitts' Law (1954):** Movement Time = a + b × log₂(2A/W)

Where:

- **A** = Amplitude (distance to target)
- **W** = Width (size of target)
- **Index of Difficulty (ID)** = log₂(2A/W)

**If the illusion affected movement, what should happen?**

(Hint: If Target A *looked* smaller, what would happen to W in the formula?)

\writingline

\writingline

**Did your data support this prediction?**

\writingline

\writingline

## 7) Your Final Insight

**What is the most surprising thing you learned from these two activities?**
