# Lab Sheet 2: Ebbinghaus Illusion - Grasping Task

**Activity:** Action vs. Perception
**Date:** Tuesday, January 27, 2026
**Reference:** Aglioti et al. (1995); Hu & Goodale (2000) - Memory delay effect

---

## 1) Setup: The Grasping Challenge

You will now **reach out and grasp** the central disks from the Ebbinghaus displays.

**Important:** We will test **two conditions**:
- **Condition A (Immediate Grasping):** Look at the target and immediately reach to grasp it.
- **Condition B (Delayed Grasping):** Look at the target, close your eyes, **wait 5 seconds**, then reach to grasp it (eyes still closed).

**Key measure:** We will observe your **Peak Grip Aperture (PGA)** - how wide your fingers open during the reach (before contact).

---

## 2) Hypothesis

Before attempting the task, generate hypotheses for both conditions:

**Hypothesis for Condition A (Immediate Grasping):**

When I reach to grasp the central disk immediately after looking at it, my hand opening (PGA) will:

☐ Scale to the **illusory size** (larger opening for the disk that *looks* bigger)
☐ Scale to the **actual size** (same opening for both disks, ignoring the illusion)
☐ Something else: _________________________________________________________________

**Why?** (What information is your hand using?)

**Hypothesis for Condition B (Delayed Grasping - 5-second delay with eyes closed):**

When I look at the disk, close my eyes, wait 5 seconds, and then grasp, my hand opening (PGA) will:

☐ Scale to the **illusory size** (the illusion will affect my grasp)
☐ Scale to the **actual size** (my hand will still be accurate)
☐ Something else: _________________________________________________________________

**Why?** (What changes when there's a delay?)

## 3) Procedure

**Materials:**
- Two Ebbinghaus displays with physical disks (poker chips or 3D-printed disks)
- Both central disks are **identical in size** (measure them if you doubt this!)

**Instructions:**

### Condition A: Immediate Grasping
1. Stand at the starting position.
2. Look at the target disk (either one).
3. **Immediately** reach out and grasp the disk using your thumb and index finger.
4. Partner observes: How wide do the fingers open at peak (before contact)?

### Condition B: Delayed Grasping (Memory Condition)
1. Stand at the starting position.
2. Look at the target disk for **2 seconds**.
3. **Close your eyes.**
4. **Wait 5 seconds** (experimenter counts: "1... 2... 3... 4... 5...").
5. While eyes are still closed, reach out and grasp the disk.
6. Partner observes: How wide do the fingers open at peak?

## 4) Data Collection

**Your Role:** Take turns being the "grasper" and the "observer."

### Observer's Task:
Watch your partner's hand carefully during the reach. Focus on the **maximum opening** of the thumb and index finger (Peak Grip Aperture) **before** they touch the disk.

Rate the PGA qualitatively:

| Participant | Target Disk | Condition A (Immediate) PGA | Condition B (Delayed) PGA |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | Surrounded by large circles | ☐ Small  ☐ Medium  ☐ Large | ☐ Small  ☐ Medium  ☐ Large |
| 1 | Surrounded by small circles | ☐ Small  ☐ Medium  ☐ Large | ☐ Small  ☐ Medium  ☐ Large |
| 2 | Surrounded by large circles | ☐ Small  ☐ Medium  ☐ Large | ☐ Small  ☐ Medium  ☐ Large |
| 2 | Surrounded by small circles | ☐ Small  ☐ Medium  ☐ Large | ☐ Small  ☐ Medium  ☐ Large |

**Optional: If measuring tools available (calipers, ruler, video analysis):**

| Participant | Target Disk | Condition A (Immediate) PGA (cm) | Condition B (Delayed) PGA (cm) |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1 | Surrounded by large circles |  |  |
| 1 | Surrounded by small circles |  |  |
| 2 | Surrounded by large circles |  |  |
| 2 | Surrounded by small circles |  |  |

## 5) Observations

**Condition A (Immediate Grasping):**

Did the PGA scale to the **illusory size** or the **actual size**?

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Condition B (Delayed Grasping with eyes closed):**

Did the PGA scale to the **illusory size** or the **actual size**?

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Was there a difference between Condition A and Condition B?**

## 6) Reflection: The Puzzle Deepens

**If the hand was accurate in Condition A (immediate grasping), what information was it using?**

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

**If the hand became less accurate (or showed illusion effects) in Condition B (delayed grasping), what does this tell us?**

(Hint: What happens to visual information after a delay? Does the hand rely on "memory" or "current information"?)

## 7) Connecting to Theory

**The Standard Story would say:**
Your brain builds a **mental representation** of the disk. If that representation is wrong (illusion), your hand should always be wrong too.

**But your data suggest:**
- Immediate grasping: ☐ Accurate  ☐ Fooled by illusion
- Delayed grasping: ☐ Accurate  ☐ Fooled by illusion

**How can we explain this dissociation?**

Think about:
- What is the difference between **perceiving for judgment** vs. **perceiving for action**?
- What is the difference between acting on **current visual information** vs. acting on **memory**?

## 8) Preview Question for Discussion

**Can we say the "hand is smarter" than the "eye"?**

Why or why not?

**Keep this lab sheet for the discussion section. We will use your observations to explore Axiom 6 (Direct Perception) and Axiom 8 (Action-Based Variables).**
