# Session Log: Course Reset & Week 3 Design
**Date:** Monday, January 26, 2026
**Agent:** Gemini CLI

## 🎯 Session Objectives
1.  Establish a "Course Bible" to ground the theoretical narrative.
2.  Refactor the class pacing due to weather-related cancellations.
3.  Establish a consistent pedagogical loop ("Setup/Payoff").
4.  Develop materials for the Week 3 reset (Ecological Optics).

## 🛠️ Work Completed

### 1. Course Foundation
*   Created [[course_bible.md]]: Established "The Computer vs. The Organism" as the core narrative.
*   Defined the **"Setup/Payoff" Loop**: Tuesdays for review/foreshadowing, Thursdays for hands-on demos/deep dives.

### 2. Week 3 Planning (The Reset)
*   **Tuesday Seminar:** [[2026_01_27_Tuesday_Seminar.md]]
    *   Integrated Ebbinghaus "Action vs. Perception" demo.
    *   Anchored discussion in Michaels (2000) critique of Milner & Goodale.
    *   "Whiteboard Only" prime for Ecological Optics (Radiant vs. Ambient light).
*   **Thursday Lab:** [[2026_01_29_Thursday_Lab.md]]
    *   Focus: Ecological Optics & Visual Proprioception.
    *   Core Activities: Moving Room (Lee & Aronson) and Grasping Tau (Savelsbergh).

### 3. Resource & Literature Management
*   **PDFs Sourced:** Lee & Aronson (1974), Savelsbergh (1991), Warren (2001), Kim (1993).
*   **Literature Notes:** Created detailed empirical notes in `100_Library/` with `#dpa` and `#optics` tags.
*   **Module Index:** [[readings_notes.md]] created in Week 03 folder.
*   **Canvas Page:** [[Canvas_w03_Ecological_Optics.md]] drafted with "Snow Day" framing for readings.

### 4. Skill Updates
*   Renamed `literature` skill to `literature-note` in `~/.agents/skills/`.

## 🧠 Strategic Context & Decisions
*   **Task Specificity:** Shifted the Ebbinghaus narrative from "Two Visual Systems" (dualism) to "Informational Variables" (ecological) based on Michaels (2000).
*   **Reading Selection:** Swapped Lee (1976) for Savelsbergh (1991) in the student-facing reading list to prioritize empirical clarity over mathematical density for the snow day assignment.

## ⏭️ Next Steps
*   [!] **Decision required:** Determine how to handle Thursday's session given the double weather cancellation (Original Week 2 vs. Scheduled Week 3 vs. Hybrid).
*   Monitor student feedback on the "Snow Day" reading packet.
