# Session Summary: Dynamics of Perception & Action (Spring 2026)
**Date:** December 23, 2025
**Project:** Course Development

## 1. Analysis of Legacy Materials
*   Reviewed Nikita Kuznetsov's Fall 2022 Syllabus and Slides.
*   Identified core structure: Classical View -> Ecological View -> Dynamics.
*   Extracted key concepts from his PPTX files to ensure continuity (e.g., "The Bad Copy," "Poverty of the Stimulus," "Tau").

## 2. New Syllabus Development
*   **File:** `20_Teaching/Dynamics of Perception & Action/Syllabus_S26.md`
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Part I:** Ecological Foundations (Gibson, Lee, Warren).
    *   **Part II:** The Dynamical Turn (Thelen, Kelso, Bernstein).
    *   **Part III:** The Modern Synthesis (Social Coordination, 4E Cognition, Predictive Processing debate).
    *   **Part IV:** Applications (Human-Machine Teaming, Design).
*   **Textbook:** Confirmed **Blau & Wagman (2022)** as the primary text. Verified it aligns perfectly with the weekly topics (Chapter 6 for Optics, Chapter 5 for Affordances, Chapter 8 for Haptics, Chapter 13 for Applications).

## 3. Readings & Resources
*   **File:** `20_Teaching/Dynamics of Perception & Action/Reading_List.md`
*   **Status:**
    *   ✅ **Classics:** Verified presence of Gibson, Lee, Turvey, Kelso PDFs in `UCedu_DPA`.
    *   ✅ **Textbook:** Verified PDF is in `readings/`.
    *   ❌ **Modern:** Identified missing papers for Part III (Rietveld, Bruineberg, Likens) to be sourced later.

## 4. Lecture Slides (Quarto/Reveal.js)
Created self-contained HTML slide decks for the first three weeks.
*   **Week 1:** The Computer vs. The Organism (`Week_1_Deck.html`)
    *   *Focus:* The "Standard Story" vs. Ecological Approach.
*   **Week 2:** Direct Perception & Optic Flow (`Week_2_Deck.html`)
    *   *Focus:* Ambient Optic Array, Global Flow, Tau.
*   **Week 3:** Affordances (`Week_3_Deck.html`)
    *   *Focus:* Warren's Stair Climbing (Pi numbers), Body Scaling.
*   **Assets:** Created `assets/` folder and added the University of Cincinnati logo (`logo.png`).

## 5. Next Steps
*   **Week 4:** Draft slides for "Dynamic Touch / Haptics" (Turvey/Carello).
*   **Assignments:** Flesh out the "Thought Papers" and "Research Proposal" details in the syllabus.
*   **Library:** Locate and download the missing "Modern Synthesis" papers.
