# Course Operating Rhythm: The "Primer-Reveal" Cadence

**Context:**
This course (Dynamics of Perception & Action) is designed as a small seminar (N=5). It uses a "Primer-Reveal" structure to drive engagement and ensure students are prepared for deep theoretical discussions.

## 1. The Weekly Arc

| Day | Event | Student Role | Instructor Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **THURSDAY** | **The Primer (Activity)** | **Explorer:** Encounter a mystery or phenomenon. Collect data. No theory yet. | **Facilitator:** Run the lab. Ask guiding questions. Assign the reading. |
| **WEEKEND** | **The Bridge (Reading)** | **Investigator:** Read the theory to explain Thursday's mystery. Take Quiz. | **None:** (Grading/Prep). |
| **TUESDAY** | **The Reveal (Seminar)** | **Analyst:** Debrief the quiz. Connect the theory to the activity. Discuss implications. | **Expert:** Deliver mini-lecture. Synthesize concepts. Lead discussion. |

## 2. Thursday Protocol: The Primer Activity

**Goal:** Create a "Need to Know."
**Time:** 75 Minutes.

1.  **0:00 - 0:15 | Field Notes (Artifact of the Week)**
    *   *Routine:* Round-robin show & tell.
    *   *Task:* Each student shares one observation/video/news item from their week.
    *   *Why:* Trains the "Ecological Eye." Warms up the room.

2.  **0:15 - 0:60 | The Activity (The Mystery)**
    *   *Routine:* Execute the planned activity (e.g., Stair Lab, Wielding Game).
    *   *Key Rule:* Do not explain the *why*. Let them struggle with the *what*.
    *   *Example:* "Why did the rod feel longer when I moved the weight? Weird. Write that down."

3.  **0:60 - 0:70 | Data/Field Notes**
    *   *Routine:* Students record raw data/observations in notebooks.
    *   *Why:* Saves grading "lab reports." Creates a personal reference for Thought Papers.

4.  **0:70 - 0:75 | The Cliffhanger**
    *   *Routine:* Assign the reading.
    *   *Script:* "To figure out why the rod felt longer, read Turvey & Carello for Tuesday."

## 3. Tuesday Protocol: The Theory Seminar

**Goal:** Satisfy the "Need to Know" & Deepen Understanding.
**Time:** 75 Minutes.

1.  **0:00 - 0:10 | Quiz Debrief**
    *   *Routine:* Review the quiz (due at 9 AM).
    *   *Focus:* Identify common misconceptions. "Everyone missed Q3 about the Inertia Tensor. Let's draw it."

2.  **0:10 - 0:40 | The Reveal (Mini-Lecture)**
    *   *Routine:* Whiteboard lecture connecting Thursday's activity to the Reading.
    *   *Example:* "The rod felt longer because $I \propto L^2$. Here is the math."

3.  **0:40 - 0:70 | Seminar Discussion**
    *   *Routine:* Student "Discussion Captain" leads or Instructor poses "Steel Man" questions.
    *   *Focus:* Implications, applications, and critiques.

4.  **0:70 - 0:75 | The Setup**
    *   *Routine:* Tease next Thursday's activity.

## 4. Assessment Integration

*   **Quizzes:** Due Tuesdays (9 AM). Ensures reading is done *after* the primer but *before* the seminar.
*   **Thought Papers:** Due Fridays (Weeks 5, 8, 15). Students use their "Field Notes" and Activity Data as evidence.
*   **Consultant's Report:** Individual presentations (Weeks 14-15).
