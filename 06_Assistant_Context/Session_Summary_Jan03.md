# Session Summary: Dynamics of Perception & Action (Spring 2026)
**Date:** January 3, 2026
**Project:** Course Development (Design Phase Complete)

## 1. Course Structure Finalized
*   **Start Date:** Tuesday, Jan 13, 2026.
*   **Schedule:** Tuesdays (Lecture/Quiz) & Thursdays (Active Learning).
*   **Primary Text:** Blau & Wagman (2022). Verified alignment with all modules.
*   **Assessments:**
    *   **Exams (40%):** Midterm & Final.
    *   **Thought Papers (20%):** 4 papers (choosing from 5 topics), due Fridays.
    *   **Case Study Presentation (25%):** Replaced Research Proposal. Pairs act as "Ecological Consultants" to solve real-world problems.
    *   **Participation (15%):** Weekly Reading Quizzes (10%) + Discussion (5%).

## 2. Materials Created
### Syllabus & Guides
*   **`Syllabus_S26.md`:** Complete schedule with correct dates, reading accountability plan, and active learning activities.
*   **`Reading_List.md`:** Master list with day-by-day breakdown (Tuesdays only, mostly).
*   **`Reading_Quiz_Guidelines.md`:** Specifications for Canvas quizzes (Apply > Understand).
*   **`Thought_Papers_Assignment.md`:** Detailed prompts for 5 topics.
*   **`Article_Presentation_Assignment.md`:** Guide for the Case Study Presentation.
*   **`Instructor_Activity_Guide.md`:** Cheat sheet for Thursday sessions (materials, setup).
*   **`Missing_Papers_List.md`:** Checklist of PDFs to source (Rietveld, Bruineberg, Likens).

### Lecture Slides (Quarto/Reveal.js)
*   **Format:** Self-contained HTMLs with "Open Sans" (Bold/SemiBold headings) and "Roboto" (Body) fonts.
*   **Deck 1:** The Computer vs. The Organism (`Week_1_Deck.html`).
*   **Deck 2:** Direct Perception & Optic Flow (`Week_2_Deck.html`).
*   **Deck 3:** Affordances (`Week_3_Deck.html`).
*   **Deck 4:** Dynamic Touch (`Week_4_Deck.html`).
*   **Assets:** University of Cincinnati logo (`assets/logo.png`) embedded.

## 3. Key Design Decisions
*   **Week 1 Load:** Redistributed readings to avoid overload before first class.
*   **AI-Resistant Strategy:**
    *   **Active Learning:** Thursday activities provide unique, in-class "data" for assignments.
    *   **Assignments:** Thought papers require application to specific personal/class contexts.
    *   **Case Studies:** Require verifying AI search results with actual PDFs.
*   **Font Style:** Slide decks updated to Open Sans (Headers) and Roboto (Body).

## 4. Next Steps (Execution Phase)
1.  **Canvas Setup:**
    *   Create the 10-12 reading quizzes based on the guidelines.
    *   Set up assignment dropboxes for Thought Papers & Presentations.
2.  **Resource Gathering:**
    *   Download missing papers (see `Missing_Papers_List.md`).
    *   Collect materials for demos (rods, weights, metronome app).
3.  **Future Content:**
    *   Draft slides for Week 5 (Dynamical Systems) and beyond.
