# Week 1 Thursday: Instructor Guide
## "The Logic Trap" - Stress-Testing the Traditional Story

**Date:** Thursday, January 16, 2026
**Duration:** 70 minutes
**Class Size:** 5 students
**Mode:** Primer (create "Need to Know" for weekend reading)

---

## Session Overview

### Pedagogical Goal
Students should leave with **questions**, not answers. They should *feel* the problems with traditional perception theory before they have the vocabulary to name them. The weekend reading (Blau & Wagman Ch 1-2) will provide the framework to understand what they experienced.

### Key Insight
All the problems trace back to **Assumption 4: Local Causality**. Don't state this explicitly until the end. Let them discover the chain.

### What This Session Is NOT
- A re-lecture of Tuesday's content
- A list of 8 assumptions to memorize
- An explanation of ecological psychology (that's Tuesday)

---

**Materials Needed**

**Required:**
- Slides: `Week_1_Thursday_Lab.qmd` (render to HTML before class)
- A crumpled paper ball (for toss activity)
- A cane or long stick (for Probe demo)
- A blindfold

**Optional but helpful:**
- Duck-rabbit image (in slides)
- Beuchet chair images (in slides)

**Images to prepare** (place in `lecture_slides/assets/`):
- `size_distance_ambiguity.png` - multiple objects producing same retinal image
- `beuchet_chair.png` - the illusion view
- `beuchet_chair_reveal.png` - the side view showing scattered parts
- `homunculus.png` - the little man diagram (reuse from Tuesday)
- `duck_rabbit.png` - classic ambiguous figure
- `cone_cylinder_sphere.png` - shapes producing circular retinal image

> **Note:** If you don't have these images, you can describe them verbally or sketch on whiteboard. The concepts work without perfect visuals.

## Detailed Timeline

### 0:00-0:15 | Field Notes (Standard Opening)

**Routine:** Round-robin share

**Prompt:** "What's one thing you noticed this week - in your daily life - that relates to perception or action? Could be something you saw, something that surprised you, a moment where you noticed yourself perceiving."

**Instructor Role:**
- Keep it moving (2-3 min per student max)
- Make brief connections: "That's interesting - hold onto that, it might come up later"
- Don't lecture or explain yet

**Goal:** Warm up the room, train the "ecological eye," build community.

### 0:15-0:27 | Part 1: Local Causality & The Outness Problem

#### Lecture Component (5-6 min)

**Slides 1-7**

**Opening hook:** "On Tuesday we sketched the traditional story. Today we stress-test it. Your job is to try to make it work. Spoiler: you can't."

**Key points to hit:**

1. **Intro S&P connection:** "You learned about transduction - light energy becomes neural signals. Where does that happen? *At the receptor*. The light literally touches your retina."

2. **Name the assumption:** "This reflects a deeper assumption: Local Causality. For A to cause B, A must touch B. Seems obvious, right? Billiard balls work this way."

3. **The problem:** "But the tree is 50 feet away. It never touches you. Yet it causes your behavior - you walk toward it. How?"

4. **The Outness Problem:** "Here's the weird part. All stimulation is local - on your retina, in your cochlea. But you don't experience light *on your eyeball*. You experience a tree *out there*. The brain only gets signals from inside the body. How does it know to project the experience outward?"

#### Activity 1: The Cane Demo (3 min)

**Instructions:**
1. Ask for a volunteer.
2. Blindfold them and hand them the cane.
3. Ask them to reach out and tap something (floor, chair leg, wall). "Tell us where it is."

**The Interaction:**
- Student: "It's right there" (points/taps).
- You: "How do you know? Did your hand touch it?"
- Student: "No, the cane did."
- You: "Do you have nerves in the cane? No. You only felt pressure *in your palm*. Yet you experienced the object *out there*."

**The Trap:** "How did the sensation migrate from your hand to the tip of the cane?"

**Let them sit with the discomfort.**

#### Activity 2: Teleporting Chair (3 min)

**Instructions:** "Everyone close your eyes. Keep them closed. Here's your challenge: Prove to me that the chair you're sitting on exists *right now*."

**Let them struggle for 30 seconds.** They may try:
- "I can feel it" → "That's using your senses now. I said prove it exists when you're not sensing it."
- "I remember it" → "That's old data. Not proof of *now*."
- "It was there a second ago" → "So? Does that prove it's there *now*?"

**The point:** "If only what touches your senses exists for you... does the world disappear when you blink? This is where local causality leads - solipsism. We'll come back to this."

### 0:27-0:39 | Part 2: Poverty of the Stimulus

#### Lecture Component (5-6 min)

**Slides 8-14**

**Intro S&P connection:** "How many depth cues did you learn in Intro? Binocular disparity, texture gradient, linear perspective, occlusion... probably 10-15 depending on your textbook. Why so many?"

**Wait for responses.**

**Your answer:** "Because the retinal image doesn't contain depth. It's flat. The 3D world projects onto a 2D surface. Depth is *lost*. That's the premise - the input is impoverished, too poor to specify the world. The brain has to add back what the image lacks."

**The geometry:** Walk through the size/distance ambiguity. "An infinite number of objects at different sizes and distances produce the *same* retinal image. The image is mathematically ambiguous."

**Size constancy:** "Your friend walks away. Retinal image shrinks 50%. You don't see them shrink. 'Size constancy.' But that's a *name*, not an *explanation*. How does the brain know to correct for distance? It needs to know the distance. But to know distance, it needs size... it's circular."

#### Activity 3: Hand Demo (2 min)

**Instructions:** "Hold your hand at arm's length. Now bring it to 6 inches from your face."

**Discussion:** "The retinal image just quadrupled. Your hand didn't 'grow.' Why not?"

**Push them:** "Size constancy is what we *call* it. What's the *rule*? How does the brain know 'ignore this size change, it's just a hand moving' versus 'that balloon is inflating'?"

**Let them struggle.**

#### Beuchet Chair (2 min)

**Show the illusion image.**

"Two people, drastically different sizes. All your depth cues are working. They're just *wrong*."

**Show the reveal image.**

"One step to the side and it collapses. It only works if you stand still, close one eye, don't move. What does that tell you about the 'cues' story?"

---

### 0:39-0:51 | Part 3: Unconscious Inference

#### Lecture Component (5-6 min)

**Slides 15-22**

**Intro S&P connection:** "Gregory's constructivist theory - 'perception is a hypothesis.' The brain doesn't passively receive, it actively constructs a best guess using sensory data plus prior knowledge plus Gestalt principles. This explains illusions - sometimes the hypothesis is wrong."

**Name the assumption:** "Helmholtz called this 'unconscious inference.' Cue + Rule + Likelihood = Perception. 'Lines converging plus rule about perspective plus most things aren't shrinking equals that object is receding.'"

**The trap - Loan of Intelligence:** "Here's the problem. To interpret the first image, you need rules. To learn rules, you need interpreted images. Where does the first rule come from? The Central Executive starts with a blank slate. Yet it needs prior knowledge to interpret *any* input."

**The trap - Infinite Regress:** "Even worse: every rule needs a rule to apply it. 'Use frequency as probability.' What rule tells you to use *that* rule here? 'I have a meta-rule.' What rule applies *that*? It's turtles all the way down."

#### Activity 4: Be the Central Executive (3-4 min)

**Show duck-rabbit image.**

**Instructions:** "You're the Central Executive. Tell me what this is."

**They answer duck or rabbit.**

**Push:** "What rule led you there?"

**They give some answer.**

**Push again:** "Why did you use *that* rule in this situation? What meta-rule?"

**Keep pushing until they feel the regress.**

"This is the Homunculus Problem. There's a little man in your head watching the screen. But who's in *his* head?"

#### Activity 5: The Cone Problem (2 min)

**Show cone/cylinder/sphere image.**

"A circle appears on your retina. What caused it? Could be a cone, cylinder, sphere... infinite possibilities."

**If they say "use context":** "Great - but you have to interpret the context too. What rule interprets the context? What rule applies *that* rule?"

"It never bottoms out."

---

### 0:51-0:63 | Part 4: Processing Time

#### Lecture Component (4-5 min)

**Slides 23-28**

**Intro S&P connection:** "You measured reaction times in lab. Simple RT, choice RT. 150-300ms. You learned about neural conduction velocity - signals travel at ~100 m/s, not instant. Processing adds delay at every synapse."

**The hidden assumption:** "If perception requires processing - inference, computation, construction - then perception takes *time*. You're always perceiving the *past*."

**The math:** Walk through the fastball example:
- Ball: 90 mph, 60 feet, ~400ms travel time
- Your processing: 250-300ms minimum
- The ball is 2/3 there before you start swinging

"You're controlling your body like NASA controls a Mars rover. See → Process → Decide → Act. Each step takes time. You're always behind."

#### Activity 6: Ball Toss (3 min)

**Pick up the crumpled paper ball.**

"I'm going to toss this to one of you. Catch it."

**Toss it. They catch it.**

"Congratulations. You just did something *impossible* according to the model we've been building."

**Discussion:** "If you had to see the ball, compute trajectory, predict landing spot, plan your arm movement, execute - you'd be too late. Every time. Yet you caught it. How?"

**Don't answer.** Let it hang.

---

### 0:63-0:70 | Wrap-Up & Reading Assignment

#### The Chain (2 min)

**Slide 29**

Walk through the chain verbally:

"Local causality → need a copy → copy is bad → must fix it → someone must do the fixing → fixing takes time → always behind → can't catch a ball."

"All of these problems trace back to *one* assumption. Local causality."

#### The Escape Hatch (2 min)

**Slide 30**

"What if we reject local causality? What if the tree *can* affect Fred without a mediator? What if there's no copy? What if the input *isn't* bad? What if perception *doesn't* require inference?"

"This is exactly what James Gibson proposed. This is exactly what you'll read this weekend."

#### Reading Assignment (1 min)

**Slide 31-32**

"Blau & Wagman, Chapters 1-2. As you read:
1. How do they trace all these problems to their root?
2. What alternative do they propose?
3. Does it actually solve the traps we found today?"

"Quiz Tuesday at 9 AM. Discussion in class."

"Tuesday we answer: If not local causality, then what? If not inference, then what? Gibson's answer: Direct Perception. See you Tuesday."

## Contingency Notes

### If discussion runs long on one section:
- Cut the Beuchet Chair (can reference verbally)
- Combine Activities 4 and 5 into one shorter discussion
- Ball toss can be cut if needed (but it's a strong closer)

### If students aren't engaging:
- Call on them directly: "Alex, you're the Central Executive. What rule are you using?"
- Make it playful: "I'm going to keep asking 'but why that rule?' until someone screams"

### If they "solve" a trap:
- They won't. But if they think they have, push: "Okay, and what rule tells you that?" or "Where did that knowledge come from originally?"
- The point is to *feel* the infinite regress, not to actually solve it

### If you run out of time:
- The essential beats: Outness Problem, Poverty of Stimulus, Infinite Regress
- Processing Time is powerful but cuttable
- Never cut the wrap-up chain and reading assignment

## Post-Session Notes

**For Tuesday prep:**
- Review their Field Notes from today (any gold?)
- Quiz should test comprehension of B&W Ch 1-2 assumptions
- Tuesday discussion should connect their Thursday experiences to B&W's framework
- Be ready to introduce Gibson and "direct perception" as the alternative

**Self-reflection:**
- Which activities landed? Which fell flat?
- Did students leave with questions or confusion?
- Questions = good (primed for reading). Confusion = needs Tuesday clarification.
