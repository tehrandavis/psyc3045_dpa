## Questions

1. The authors use the metaphor of a "polar planimeter" (a mechanical tool that measures area by tracing a shape) to illustrate which core ecological concept?
   - a. The brain must perform complex calculations to understand the world.
   - b. A system can detect higher-order variables (like area or affordances) directly without first measuring lower-order parts (like length and width).
   - c. Perception is inaccurate, much like a mechanical tool that slips and slides.
   - d. We need a "Central Executive" to interpret the data our senses collect.

2. The authors describe a scenario where Fred and Bill are in a movie theater. They can see the screen and the projector, but the space between them looks dark. What point does this example illustrate?
   - a. Light itself is invisible; we only perceive surfaces that are illuminated by light.
   - b. The "fog" of sensory information requires the brain to reconstruct reality.
   - c. The cinema screen acts like the retina, receiving a flat, static image.
   - d. Visual perception requires active movement to be accurate.

3. Why does the ecological approach reject the idea of a "Central Executive" (a boss in the brain) making decisions?
   - a. It leads to a logical "infinite regress" (who tells the executive what to do?).
   - b. It creates a "loan of intelligence" problem (assuming intelligence to explain intelligence).
   - c. It suffers from the "outness problem" (how does it know signals are from the outside world?).
   - d. All of the above.

4. To explain "self-organization" without a leader, the authors describe an experiment with metronomes placed on a board resting on soup cans. What caused the metronomes to synchronize their ticking?
   - a. One "master" metronome was wound tighter than the others.
   - b. The shared movement of the board created a physical constraint that coupled their rhythms naturally.
   - c. The metronomes were programmed with identical internal frequencies.
   - d. Fred tapped the board in time with the beat to train them.

5. Haffenden et al. (2001) investigated the Ebbinghaus illusion (where a central circle looks smaller when surrounded by large circles). What was their key finding regarding the difference between *perception* (estimation) and *action* (grasping)?
   - a. Both perception and grasping were equally fooled by the illusion.
   - b. Grasping was fooled by the illusion, but manual estimation was accurate.
   - c. Perception was fooled by the illusion, but grasping was largely accurate and determined by the physical distance of the obstacles (flankers).
   - d. Neither perception nor grasping were affected by the display.

## Answer Key

1. **b** - A system can detect higher-order variables directly without first measuring lower-order parts
2. **a** - Light itself is invisible; we only perceive surfaces that are illuminated by light
3. **d** - All of the above (infinite regress, loan of intelligence, outness problem)
4. **b** - The shared movement of the board created a physical constraint that coupled their rhythms naturally
5. **c** - Perception was fooled by the illusion, but grasping was largely accurate and determined by the physical distance of the obstacles (flankers)
