## Seminar Routine: "Artifact of the Week" (Warm-up)
**Goal:** Train the "Ecological Eye" by connecting theory to the wild.
**Format:** Round-Robin Show & Tell (First 10 mins of every Thursday).
**Task:** Students must bring *one artifact* they encountered during the week that illustrates the current topic.
-   **Examples:** A TikTok video of a sports fail, a news headline about autonomous cars, a design flaw in their kitchen, a screenshot from a video game.
-   **Facilitation:** "Student A, what did you see?" -> "How does that connect to [Current Concept]?"

## Part I: Foundations

### Week 1 (Jan 15): "The Robot vs. The Outfielder" Debate
**Goal:** Contrast computational vs. ecological approaches to interception.
**Format:** "The Design Firm" (Collaborative Problem Solving).
**Materials:**
- Whiteboard/markers.
- A tennis ball (for tossing while explaining).
**Setup:**
1.  **Scenario:** The class is a single engineering consulting firm. You (Instructor) are the "Skeptical CEO."
2.  **The Challenge:** You want to build a robot outfielder. You believe the "Computational" approach (calculating trajectory, wind, gravity) is best.
3.  **The Task:** The students must work *together* to convince you that the "Ecological" approach (OAC - Optical Acceleration Cancellation) is cheaper, faster, and more robust.
**Facilitation:**
- Play devil's advocate: "But I have a fast processor! Why can't I just calculate gravity?"
- Force them to explain the *cost* of computation vs. the *efficiency* of law-based control.

### Week 2 (Jan 22): Visualizing Tau
**Goal:** Demonstrate that Time-to-Contact is specified optically.
**Format:** Video Analysis / Prediction.
**Materials:**
- Projector/Screen.
- "Looming" video clips (pov of car approaching wall, ball approaching face).
- Stopwatch app.
**Setup:**
1.  Play video of approaching object. Pause it 2 seconds before impact.
2.  Ask students to predict *exactly* when impact would occur.
3.  Reveal actual time.
**Facilitation:**
- Explain: "You didn't know the distance (meters) or speed (mph). How did you know *when*?"
- Show the Tau math: $\tau = A / \dot{A}$ (Current size / Rate of expansion).

### Week 3 (Jan 29): The Great Stair Lab
**Goal:** Demonstrate body-scaling and dimensionless numbers ($\\pi$).
**Format:** Field Trip (Deep Data Collection).
**Materials:**
- Tape measures (one per student).
- Notebooks.
**Setup:**
1.  Go to diverse staircases (steep, shallow, standard, ramp).
2.  **Data Collection:** Each student measures *3 different staircases* ($R$) and their own leg length ($L$).
3.  **Rating:** Rate "climbability" (1-10) and "comfort" for *each* staircase.
**Facilitation:**
- **Plot Individual Curves:** Do not aggregate. Plot each student's comfort curve vs. their $R/L$ ratio.
- Discuss: Why does Student A's curve peak at a different physical height than Student B's? (Body scaling).

### Week 4 (Feb 5): The Wielding Game
**Goal:** Demonstrate dynamic touch and the Inertia Tensor.
**Format:** Blindfolded Perception Experiment.
**Materials:**
- "Tensor Objects" (rods with weights attached at different positions).
- Blindfolds (or just ask students to close eyes).
- Comparison scale (e.g., a whiteboard with lines drawn at different lengths).
**Setup:**
1.  Student A holds rod behind a curtain (or eyes closed).
2.  Student A wields rod (wrist only) and estimates length.
3.  Student B records estimate.
4.  **Manipulation:** Move the weight further out. Repeat.
**Facilitation:**
- Show that perceived length increases as rotational inertia ($I$) increases, even if physical length is constant.
- "You aren't feeling length; you are feeling resistance to rotation."

## Part II: The Dynamical Turn

### Week 5 (Feb 12): Mapping Your Attractors
**Goal:** Apply dynamical systems terminology to personal behavior.
**Format:** Personal Reflection / Visualization.
**Materials:**
- Paper/Pencil.
**Setup:**
1.  Ask students to pick a habit (e.g., sleep schedule, phone checking).
2.  Draw a "potential landscape" (the ball and valley).
3.  Identify the **Attractor** (what do you usually do?).
4.  Identify a **Repeller** (what do you actively avoid?).
5.  Identify a **Control Parameter** (what changes the landscape? e.g., stress, caffeine).
**Facilitation:**
- Share examples. "When I drink coffee (control parameter), my 'sleep' attractor becomes shallower (less stable)."

### Week 6 (Feb 19): The Finger Wiggling Phase Transition
**Goal:** Experience a non-linear phase transition.
**Format:** Formal Lab Experiment (N=1 Design).
**Materials:**
- Metronome (use an app connected to speakers).
**Setup:**
1.  Start metronome slow (120 bpm).
2.  **Trials:** Each student performs 5 complete trials (increasing speed until switch).
3.  **Data:** Record the "critical frequency" (switch point) for each trial.
**Facilitation:**
- Calculate personal mean and variance for each student.
- **Discussion:** Why did Student A switch at 2.5Hz while Student B switched at 3.0Hz? (Intrinsic dynamics, stability).

### Week 7 (Feb 26): The Frozen Limb Challenge
**Goal:** Experience the Degrees of Freedom (DOF) problem.
**Format:** Motor Learning Game.
**Materials:**
- Tennis balls or bean bags.
- Bucket/Target.
**Setup:**
1.  **Stage 1 (Novice):** Students must throw ball into bucket but keep elbow and wrist rigid (frozen). Only shoulder moves. (Hard/Awkward).
2.  **Stage 2 (Expert):** Unfreeze joints. Allow "synergy" (whip-like motion).
**Facilitation:**
- Connect to Bernstein: "Novices freeze DOFs to simplify control. Experts release DOFs to exploit reactive forces."

## Part III: The Modern Synthesis

### Week 9 (Mar 12): The Unintentional Sync
**Goal:** Demonstrate emergent social coordination.
**Format:** Dyad Lab (Instructor Participates).
**Materials:**
- Rocking chairs (if avail) OR just walking space.
- Metronome app (for recording tempo).
**Setup:**
1.  Pair students up. (Instructor pairs with the odd student).
2.  **Condition A:** Walk/Rock while looking away. Measure tempo.
3.  **Condition B:** Walk/Rock while looking at each other (or talking). Measure tempo.
**Facilitation:**
- **Instructor Move:** Subtly manipulate your attention/gaze to demonstrate "coupling strength."
- Did they synchronize? Was it intentional? (Usually not). It's a "social synergy."

### Week 10 (Mar 19): Tech Affordance Audit
**Goal:** Apply "Landscape of Affordances" to technology.
**Format:** Design Critique.
**Materials:**
- Students' own smartphones.
**Setup:**
1.  Open a social media app (TikTok, Instagram).
2.  Identify **Solicitations:** What lights up/moves to invite action?
3.  Identify **Arresting:** What design choice stops you from leaving? (Infinite scroll = no stopping cue).
**Facilitation:**
- "Rietveld says affordances 'solicit' action. How does this app scream 'CLICK ME'?"

### Week 11 (Mar 26): The Council of Science (Roleplay)
**Goal:** Synthesize Ecological vs. Predictive Processing frameworks.
**Format:** Roleplay Roundtable.
**Materials:**
- Name placards for characters.
**Setup:**
1.  Assign personas to students:
    - **James Gibson** (The Purist: "It's all in the light!")
    - **Andy Clark** (The Bayesian: "The brain is a prediction machine.")
    - **Esther Thelen** (The Dynamist: "It emerges from the body.")
    - **The Skeptic** (You/Student: Pokes holes in everything.)
2.  **Task:** Pose a problem (e.g., "Explain the Stair Lab results"). Students must debate *in character*.
**Facilitation:**
- Encourage students to use specific vocabulary from their character's "worldview."

### Week 12 (Apr 2): Affordance Competition Game
**Goal:** Visualize Cisek's parallel action preparation.
**Format:** Tabletop Simulation.
**Materials:**
- Poker chips or Post-it notes (representing "neural activation").
- Tabletop target object (e.g., a cup).
**Setup:**
1.  Place target object on table. Mark "Left Reach" and "Right Reach" zones.
2.  **Simulation:** As instructor moves the object, students physically pile chips onto the zones.
3.  **Ambiguity:** If object is in middle, pile chips equally.
4.  **Decision:** Once object moves clearly left, "Left" pile surges, "Right" pile is removed (inhibition).
**Facilitation:**
- Visualizes the "race model" dynamics on a shared tabletop.

## Part IV: Applications

### Week 13 (Apr 9): Trust Fall with a Robot
**Goal:** Apply Ecological Interface Design (EID).
**Format:** Design Scenario.
**Materials:**
- Paper/markers for sketching.
**Setup:**
1.  **Scenario:** You are in a Level 5 autonomous car. You want to sleep.
2.  **Problem:** How does the car communicate "I have this under control" without waking you up with beeps?
3.  **Task:** Design an ambient display (light, vibration, peripheral motion) that specifies "Trustworthiness" or "Capability."
**Facilitation:**
- Connect to "Asymmetric Coordination." The car needs to be a "teammate," not a tool.
