# Reading Quiz Guidelines - DPA Spring 2026

## Purpose
Weekly reading quizzes ensure students come prepared to engage with course material. Research shows quizzes promote deeper comprehension than journals or other accountability methods (Hoeft, 2012).

## Format
- **Platform:** Canvas (auto-graded)
- **Frequency:** Every Tuesday (except Week 1 Tuesday)
- **Opens:** Thursday after class (~2:30 PM)
- **Closes:** Tuesday at class start time (exact time TBD)
- **Questions:** 5 per quiz
- **Time Limit:** 10 minutes (once started)
- **Attempts:** 1 attempt only
- **Weight:** Each quiz = 1% of final grade (participation component)

## Question Design Principles

### ✅ GOOD: Test Understanding & Application (Bloom's: Understand/Apply)

**Example (Week 2 - Optic Flow):**
> **Q:** A baseball outfielder tracking a fly ball uses tau to judge time-to-contact. If the optical angle of the ball is expanding rapidly, what does this indicate?
>
> A) The ball is moving slowly
> B) The ball will land far away
> C) **The ball will arrive soon** ✓
> D) The ball is at a constant distance

**Why this works:** Requires applying the tau concept to predict behavior, not just defining tau.

---

**Example (Week 3 - Affordances):**
> **Q:** A stair riser is 25cm high. For which person does it afford comfortable climbing (using Warren's 0.88 leg-length ratio)?
>
> A) Person with 20cm leg length
> B) **Person with 30cm leg length** ✓
> C) Person with 50cm leg length
> D) Cannot determine without more information

**Why this works:** Requires calculating pi-number and applying body-scaling concept.

---

### ❌ AVOID: Pure Recall Questions (Bloom's: Remember)

**Bad Example:**
> Q: Who developed the theory of affordances?
> A) Warren
> B) **Gibson** ✓
> C) Kelso
> D) Bernstein

**Why this fails:** Students can memorize names without understanding concepts. Doesn't assess comprehension.

---

**Bad Example:**
> Q: What does tau stand for?
> A) Time and understanding
> B) **Time-to-contact** ✓
> C) Temporal analysis unit
> D) Trajectory average understanding

**Why this fails:** Vocabulary recall, not conceptual understanding.

## Question Types to Use

### 1. **Scenario Application** (Best for Apply-level)
Present a real-world scenario, ask students to apply concepts.

**Template:**
> [Scenario description]. Based on [concept from reading], what would happen / what explains this / how would you predict...?

**Example (Week 6 - HKB Model):**
> Two people are rocking in chairs side-by-side. As they increase rocking frequency, they spontaneously switch from rocking in-phase to anti-phase. This is an example of:
>
> A) Intentional coordination
> B) **A phase transition** ✓
> C) Mirror neuron activation
> D) Affordance perception

---

### 2. **Conceptual Contrast** (Good for Understand-level)
Ask students to distinguish between related concepts.

**Example (Week 1 - Computational vs. Ecological):**
> The computational approach to perception assumes:
>
> A) The environment provides rich, lawful information
> B) **The stimulus is impoverished and requires inference** ✓
> C) Perception is direct and unmediated
> D) Animals detect invariants in the optic array

---

### 3. **Example Identification** (Good for Understand/Apply)
Provide examples, ask which best illustrates a concept.

**Example (Week 4 - Dynamic Touch):**
> Which scenario best demonstrates dynamic touch?
>
> A) Seeing the length of a stick by looking at it
> B) **Wielding a hockey stick to judge its length and weight distribution** ✓
> C) Touching a surface to feel its texture
> D) Hearing the sound of a hammer hitting a nail

---

### 4. **Prediction/Inference** (Best for Apply-level)
Present incomplete scenario, ask students to predict outcome using concepts.

**Example (Week 5 - Dynamical Systems):**
> A system has a single attractor at State A. If perturbed slightly, the system will:
>
> A) Move to a new stable state
> B) **Return to State A** ✓
> C) Oscillate between states indefinitely
> D) Exhibit chaotic behavior

---

## Distribution Across Bloom's Levels

**Per 5-question quiz:**
- 2 questions = Understand level (conceptual distinctions, explanations)
- 3 questions = Apply level (scenarios, predictions, calculations)

**Avoid:**
- Pure recall questions (Remember level)
- Overly complex multi-step problems (too hard for timed quiz)

## Sample Quiz: Week 2 (Direct Perception & Optic Flow)

**Readings:** Gibson Ch 1 + B&W Ch 6

**Q1 (Understand):** According to Gibson, what makes perception "direct"?
> A) It requires conscious inference
> B) **It detects information without intermediate representations** ✓
> C) It depends on prior knowledge
> D) It uses computational algorithms

**Q2 (Apply):** You're driving toward a bridge. The optical angle of the bridge is expanding. What can you infer?
> A) The bridge is moving
> B) **You are approaching the bridge** ✓
> C) The bridge is getting larger
> D) You are moving away from the bridge

**Q3 (Understand):** The "poverty of the stimulus" argument claims:
> A) The environment provides too much information
> B) **Sensory input is insufficient to specify perception** ✓
> C) Animals detect invariant properties directly
> D) Perception requires no processing

**Q4 (Apply):** A gannet diving into water folds its wings at a precise time-to-contact. This behavior is best explained by:
> A) Calculating velocity and distance
> B) **Detecting tau (optical expansion rate)** ✓
> C) Learning through trial-and-error
> D) Innate pre-programmed reflexes

**Q5 (Understand):** Optic flow refers to:
> A) The flow of neural signals in the optic nerve
> B) **The pattern of visual motion as an observer moves** ✓
> C) The speed of light traveling through space
> D) The movement of the eyeball during saccades

## Grading & Feedback

**Canvas Settings:**
- Auto-graded (multiple choice)
- Show correct answers after due date (Tuesday class)
- Students can review their quiz after submission
- No partial credit (all-or-nothing per question)

**Points:**
- Each quiz = 5 points (1 point per question)
- Total participation grade = 50 points (10 quizzes × 5 points)
- Participation = 10% of final grade

**Dropped Quizzes:**
- Consider dropping lowest 1-2 quiz scores to account for illness/emergencies

## Implementation Checklist

### Before Semester:
- [ ] Create 10-12 quizzes on Canvas (Weeks 2-13, excluding midterm week)
- [ ] Set availability windows (opens Thursday 2:30 PM, closes Tuesday class time)
- [ ] Configure settings (1 attempt, 10 min limit, auto-grade)
- [ ] Test quizzes from student view

### Week 1:
- [ ] Announce quiz policy in syllabus review (Tuesday)
- [ ] Explain purpose: accountability + comprehension (not punishment)
- [ ] First quiz goes live Thursday Week 1 (for readings due Week 2 Tuesday)

### Weekly Routine:
- **Tuesday after class:** Review quiz results, note common struggles
- **Thursday:** Address misconceptions in class if >50% missed a question
- **Thursday after class:** Open next week's quiz

## FAQ for Students

**Q: Can I retake the quiz if I do poorly?**
A: No, quizzes have one attempt. They're designed to encourage reading before class, not to test how well you can look up answers.

**Q: What if I miss class on Tuesday?**
A: The quiz is due at class start time whether you attend or not. Complete it before class.

**Q: Are quizzes open-book?**
A: Yes, you can reference readings. However, with only 10 minutes and 5 questions, you won't have time to look everything up. Best strategy is to do the reading first.

**Q: What if I have a legitimate emergency?**
A: We drop your lowest 1-2 quiz scores to account for emergencies. If you have extended circumstances, contact me directly.
