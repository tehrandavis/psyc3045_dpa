# Thought Paper Assignment Guidelines

## Overview
Throughout the semester, you will write **4 thought papers** chosen from 5 possible topics. These short papers (2-3 pages) are designed to help you apply the theoretical concepts of ecological psychology and dynamical systems to real-world scenarios.

**Total Weight:** 20% of final grade (5% per paper).
**Requirement:** You must complete **4 out of the 5** opportunities. You may choose which topic to skip.

## Format & Requirements
- **Length:** 500–750 words (approx. 2–3 pages, double-spaced).
- **Style:** APA style citations for any references.
- **Submission:** Upload to Canvas by 11:59 PM on the due date.

## Structure (The 40/60 Rule)
Each paper should follow this general structure:

1.  **Conceptual Grounding (approx. 40%):** Clearly explain the key theoretical concept(s) you are using. Define terms accurately as used in class and readings. Show me you understand the *mechanism*.
2.  **Application (approx. 60%):** Apply that concept to a specific, concrete real-world scenario. This is not a summary of the reading; it is an exercise in using the theory as a tool to analyze the world.

## Evaluation Rubric

| Criteria | Excellent (5 pts) | Good (4 pts) | Fair (3 pts) | Poor (0-2 pts) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conceptual Understanding (40%)** | Accurate, precise definition of concepts; connects correctly to course theory. | Generally accurate but minor precision errors; mostly connects to theory. | Vague or slightly inaccurate definitions; weak connection to theory. | Major misunderstandings of core concepts. |
| **Application & Analysis (40%)** | Novel, insightful application; goes beyond surface level; distinct "Aha!" moment. | Solid application to a clear example; logical but predictable. | Example is weak or doesn't fit the theory well; superficial analysis. | No clear application or irrelevant example. |
| **Clarity & Writing (20%)** | Clear, concise, well-structured; professional tone; no errors. | Clear with minor issues; generally good structure. | Hard to follow in places; structural issues. | Poorly written; confusing. |

## Topics & Prompts

Choose **ONE** prompt from the available options for each topic you select.

### Topic 1: Dynamic Touch & Haptics
**Due:** Friday, Feb 13 (Week 4)

*   **Option A: The Wielding Problem.** Choose a tool or sports implement you are familiar with (e.g., tennis racket, hammer, surgical instrument, chef's knife). Explain the concept of the *inertia tensor* and how it relates to the perception of length and "heavy-to-the-hand." How does the distribution of mass (not just total weight) affect how you use this tool?
*   **Option B: Non-Visual Perception.** Describe a task you perform primarily through touch (e.g., finding keys in a bag, typing, tying shoelaces in the dark). Analyze this task using the concept of *haptic touch* vs. *cutaneous touch*. What information is being detected? How does active exploration reveal properties of the object?

### Topic 2: Coordination Dynamics & Synergies
**Due:** Friday, Feb 27 (Week 6)

*   **Option A: The HKB Model in Real Life.** Identify a rhythmic behavior you perform or observe (e.g., walking gait, drumming, clapping). Describe a *phase transition* you have experienced or can observe (e.g., switching from walking to running, or a breakdown in drumming pattern). What was the *control parameter* (e.g., speed) that caused the switch? What implies the system is "self-organizing"?
*   **Option B: The Degrees of Freedom Problem.** Bernstein asked how we control the redundant degrees of freedom in our body. Analyze a complex movement (e.g., throwing a ball, playing a piano chord). Explain how *synergies* (functional groupings of muscles/joints) might simplify the control problem in this specific movement. What would it look like if the DOFs were controlled individually?

### Topic 3: Social Coordination
**Due:** Friday, Mar 27 (Week 9)

*   **Option A: Spontaneous Synchronization.** Observation assignment: Watch people walking together, rocking in chairs, or applauding. Describe an instance of spontaneous synchronization. Use the concepts of *coupling* and *entrainment* to explain why this happened without verbal communication. Was the coupling visual, auditory, or mechanical?
*   **Option B: Joint Action.** Analyze a team activity (e.g., moving a couch with a friend, a rowing crew, a dance partner). How does the team function as a single *synergy*? Discuss the role of shared affordances—do the individuals perceive the "team's" action capabilities rather than just their own?

### Topic 4: Ecological vs. Predictive Processing
**Due:** Friday, Apr 10 (Week 11)

*   **Option A: The Debate.** Select one phenomenon (e.g., catching a ball, illusions, anticipation in sports). Contrast how an Ecological Psychologist (Direct Perception) and a Predictive Processing theorist (Inference/Model-based) would explain it. Which explanation do you find more parsimonious, and why?
*   **Option B: "Surprise" in the Wild.** Predictive Processing relies heavily on "prediction error" or surprise. Ecological psychology relies on "information pickup." Describe a situation where you were "surprised" by a physical interaction (e.g., lifting a milk carton you thought was full but was empty). Analyze this event from both perspectives. Did you have a wrong *model*, or did you fail to detect the correct *specification* of weight?

### Topic 5: Human-Machine Teaming & Design
**Due:** Friday, Apr 24 (Week 13)

*   **Option A: The "Uncanny Valley" of Interaction.** Interact with an AI agent (chatbot, video game NPC) or a physical robot/machine. Identify a moment where the interaction felt "clunky" or failed. Analyze this failure in terms of *broken coupling* or *misleading affordances*. What information was missing that a human partner would have provided?
*   **Option B: Designing for Trust.** Trust in human-machine teams is often described as a "stable relation." Propose a design feature for a semi-autonomous car or robot that would enhance trust using dynamical concepts (e.g., providing continuous feedback, matching the human's tempo). Why would this feature create a more stable human-machine system?
