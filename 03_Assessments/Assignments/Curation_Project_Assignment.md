# Assignment: Phenomenon Curation Project
**"Become the Expert"**

## Overview
In this seminar, we cover the broad strokes of Ecological Psychology. For this major project, you will dive deep into a specific **Perception-Action Phenomenon** of your choice. You will act as a "Curator," gathering a collection of scientific and popular artifacts to explain this phenomenon to your peers, and then lead a seminar discussion on it.

## The Mission
1.  **Select a Phenomenon:** Choose a specific, observable behavior or effect (e.g., The "Yips", VR motion sickness, phantom limbs, auditory looming).
2.  **Curate the Collection:** Gather a diverse set of artifacts (aim for ~5-6 items total) to illustrate this phenomenon. Your collection **must** include:
    *   **The Science:** **2-3 primary empirical research papers** (PDFs) investigating the mechanism.
    *   **The Culture/Application:** Popular science articles, news headlines, podcast clips, or design applications.
    *   **The Experience:** A video or multimedia clip showing the phenomenon in action.
    *   *Note:* There are no hard maximums. If you find 4 great papers and 1 video, that's fine. If you find 2 papers and 3 amazing design examples, that's also fine. But the scientific grounding must be solid.
3.  **Lead the Seminar:** You are the instructor for 30 minutes.

## Deliverables & Schedule (Three Check-ins)

To ensure you are on track, you will check in with me at three points during the semester. These are opportunities for feedback, not just grading hurdles.

### Check-in 1: The Pitch
*   **Due:** Week 5 (Friday, Feb 13)
*   **Task:** Submit a 1-page proposal.
    *   What is the phenomenon?
    *   Why is it interesting/relevant to ecological psychology?
    *   List 1 potential scientific paper you have found.

### Check-in 2: The Curation List
*   **Due:** Week 9 (Friday, Mar 13)
*   **Task:** Submit your annotated bibliography/artifact list.
    *   List your 2-3 empirical papers (with PDFs).
    *   List your pop/culture artifacts.
    *   Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of how each connects to the topic.

### Check-in 3: The Lesson Plan
*   **Due:** Week 12 (Friday, Apr 3)
*   **Task:** Submit a draft outline of your seminar segment.
    *   How will you introduce the topic? (The Hook)
    *   What key data will you show?
    *   **What are your 3 Discussion Questions?**

### Final Deliverable: The Seminar
*   **Due:** Weeks 14-15 (In Class)
*   **Task:** 30-minute presentation + Discussion Lead.

## Grading Rubric (25% of Course Grade)

| Criteria | Excellent (A) | Proficient (B) | Needs Improvement (C/D) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Curation Quality** | Collection is rich and diverse. Empirical papers are rigorous and relevant. Cultural artifacts provide excellent context. | Collection meets requirements. Papers are relevant but maybe basic. Good mix of media. | Collection is sparse. Missing empirical papers or relying too heavily on pop science. |
| **Scientific Mastery** | Clearly explains the *mechanism* across multiple papers. Synthesizes findings rather than just summarizing. | Explains the general idea of the papers. accurate summaries. | Misunderstands the science or fails to connect the papers. |
| **Presentation Style** | Engaging, professional, uses the 30 mins perfectly. "The Teacher." | Clear but dry. Rushed or too short. | Disorganized, reads off slides, or goes way over time. |
| **Discussion Leadership** | Questions sparked genuine debate. Facilitated the conversation well. | Questions were factual/yes-no. Discussion stalled. | No prepared questions or unable to answer peer questions. |
