# Thought Papers - Revised Framework (Integrating Strategies 3, 4, 7, 10)

## Design Philosophy

This revision integrates four key strategies:
- **Strategy 10:** Transparent assignment design (clear purpose, tasks, criteria)
- **Strategy 7:** AI as collaborative tool (when appropriate)
- **Strategy 3:** Extension of class discourse (prompts evolve with course)
- **Strategy 4:** Reflection and metacognition (process matters)

**Key Innovation:** Prompts are **partially developed in advance** but **finalized based on actual class discussions, demos, and debates**. This makes them inherently AI-resistant while remaining relevant to student experiences.

## Universal Paper Structure (All 3 Papers)

### Assignment Template Format (Strategy 10: Transparent Design)

Each paper assignment will include:

#### **PURPOSE (Why This Matters)**
Clear statement of:
- What learning goal this serves
- How it connects to future work (next paper, research proposal, career)
- Why integration matters for this topic

#### **TASKS (What You'll Do)**
Broken into clear, actionable steps:
1. **Preparation phase** (in-class or pre-work)
2. **Development phase** (drafting with or without AI)
3. **Reflection phase** (metacognitive component)
4. **Submission requirements** (what to include)

#### **CRITERIA (What Success Looks Like)**
- Link to exemplars (past student work, if available)
- Rubric emphasizing:
  - **Conceptual integration** (not just listing concepts)
  - **Class-specific references** (demos, discussions, debates)
  - **Personal insight** (what AI can't provide)
  - Deemphasize: grammar, formatting, length (AI-friendly criteria)

## Paper 1: Ecological Foundations (Weeks 2-4)

### PURPOSE

**Why this paper matters:**
This paper develops your ability to see how multiple ecological principles work together in real perception-action systems. Ecological psychology argues that perception is direct—no computation needed—because rich information is available in optic flow, affordances, and haptic arrays. But these principles don't operate in isolation. Understanding their integration is essential for analyzing how real organisms act in real environments.

**Connection to future work:**
The integration skills you develop here will prepare you for Paper 2 (coordinating multiple dynamical concepts) and your Research Proposal (designing experiments that test multiple variables). Professional researchers rarely study single concepts in isolation—you're learning to think like a researcher.

---

### TASKS

#### **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 2-4 Class Activities)**

**During Week 2 (Optic Flow/Tau):**
- Participate in tau demo (Thursday, Jan 22)
- Note: Your observations from this demo will be referenced in your paper

**During Week 3 (Affordances):**
- Participate in affordances case study (Thursday, Jan 29)
- Note: Your group discussions will inform your paper

**During Week 4 (Dynamic Touch):**
- Participate in haptic perception demo
- Note: Personal experiences will be incorporated in paper

#### **Phase 2: Prompt Finalization (End of Week 4)**

**IMPORTANT:** The specific prompt for Paper 1 will be finalized and posted on **Friday, Feb 6** (one week before deadline). The prompt will incorporate:
- Specific debates or insights from Week 2-4 class discussions
- Results from the demos we conducted
- Examples that emerged during group work

**Why wait to finalize the prompt?**
This ensures your paper responds to OUR course discourse, not generic textbook knowledge. AI wasn't in our classroom—you were.

**Preliminary Prompt Options** (final version will be based on one of these, customized to our class):

##### **Option 1A: Navigation & Mobility (Class-Specific Version)**
*[This will be customized based on actual class discussions]*

Preliminary template:
> "Analyze YOUR navigation through a specific environment you regularly experience (your commute to campus, navigation through the rec center, skateboarding route, etc.).
>
> **Integration requirements:**
> - **Optic flow/tau:** Reference our Week 2 tau demo. How does the optical information you experience compare to what we observed in class?
> - **Affordances:** Reference our Week 3 case study discussion. Apply the same analysis framework to YOUR environment.
> - **Dynamic touch:** Reference our Week 4 haptic demo. If you use any objects (bike, skateboard, cane), analyze using the principles we experienced.
>
> **Class discourse connection:**
> In your Conceptual Synthesis (Part 1), address this question that emerged in Week [X] discussion: [SPECIFIC DEBATE FROM CLASS]. Take a position and defend it using the three concepts integrated."

##### **Option 1B: Sports & Skilled Action (Class-Specific Version)**

Preliminary template:
> "Choose a sport or skilled activity you PERSONALLY perform or have performed.
>
> **Integration requirements:**
> - **Optic flow/tau:** Connect to our Week 2 tau demo findings. How does timing in your sport compare?
> - **Affordances:** Apply the body-scaling analysis we practiced in Week 3 case study.
> - **Dynamic touch:** Connect to our Week 4 haptic demo. Analyze equipment or implements.
>
> **Class discourse connection:**
> During Week [X], we debated [SPECIFIC DEBATE]. Use your sport to illustrate which position you find more compelling and why."

##### **Option 1C: Assistive Technology (Class-Specific Version)**

Preliminary template:
> "Interview someone who uses assistive technology OR analyze your own experience with mobility aids/devices.
>
> **Integration requirements:**
> - All three concepts applied to the person + device system
> - Reference findings from ALL three weeks of demos
> - Address how the device changes the perception-action coupling
>
> **Class discourse connection:**
> In Week [X], [STUDENT NAME] raised the question of [SPECIFIC QUESTION]. Use your interview/analysis to explore this question."

---

#### **Phase 3: AI-Enhanced Development (Optional - Strategy 7)**

**For students who want to use AI as a thinking tool:**

You may optionally use AI to enhance your paper development, but you must document and reflect on the process. If you choose this path:

1. **After choosing your scenario** (but before drafting), enter THIS prompt into ChatGPT:
   > "I'm writing a paper integrating Gibson's optic flow/tau, affordances, and dynamic touch to analyze [YOUR SCENARIO]. Generate an analysis."

2. **Critical evaluation:** Create a document noting:
   - What did AI get right? (cite course readings to verify)
   - What did AI miss? (what class discussions/demos did it not reference?)
   - What is generic vs. specific to your scenario?
   - Any factual errors or "hallucinations"?

3. **Human enhancement:** Take the best ideas (yours or AI's) and improve them by:
   - Adding class-specific references AI doesn't have
   - Incorporating your personal experience AI can't replicate
   - Correcting errors or superficial analysis
   - Deepening integration (AI tends to list concepts separately)

4. **Required AI Transparency Appendix** (if you use AI):
   - Include ChatGPT's original response
   - Your annotated critique (what was good/bad/missing)
   - Brief reflection: "What value did I add beyond AI?" (1 paragraph)

**Grading note:** If you use AI, you will be graded on:
- Quality of your critical evaluation of AI output
- Depth of improvement beyond AI's response
- Class-specific integration AI couldn't provide
- Your reflection on AI's limitations

**NOT using AI is perfectly fine!** Many students find that generating their own ideas from scratch leads to more authentic, class-connected work.

---

#### **Phase 4: Reflection Component (Strategy 4 - Required for All)**

After completing your Integrated Application (Part 2), add a **Brief Reflection** (1/2 page):

**Metacognitive Prompts:**
- What was most challenging about integrating three concepts? How did you overcome this?
- How did class discussions or demos change your initial understanding?
- If you used AI: What did you learn about AI's limitations for this kind of analysis?
- If you didn't use AI: What made your human analysis stronger than what AI could produce?

---

### SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

**Your submission must include:**

1. **Part 1: Conceptual Synthesis** (~1 page, 200-300 words)
   - Explain how the three concepts relate
   - Reference at least one class discussion or demo
   - Address the class-specific debate/question from the prompt

2. **Part 2: Integrated Application** (~1.5-2 pages, 300-450 words)
   - Analyze your specific scenario
   - Integrate all three concepts (not separate sections)
   - Include personal observations or experiences

3. **Part 3: Brief Reflection** (~0.5 page, 100-150 words)
   - Respond to metacognitive prompts above

4. **Optional Appendix (if AI was used):**
   - AI output (screenshot or copy-paste)
   - Your annotated critique
   - Reflection on value you added

**Total length:** 2-3 pages (NOT including AI appendix if used)

**Format:**
- Double-spaced, 12pt Times New Roman or Arial
- Include in-text citations (Author, Year)
- Filename: `LastName_Paper1_DPA.pdf`

---

### CRITERIA FOR SUCCESS

**What makes this paper excellent?**

✅ **Deep integration** (not just listing concepts)
- Example: "The cyclist uses tau to time braking, but the brake-ability affordance is only perceived through dynamic touch feedback from handlebar vibration, creating a closed perception-action loop."

✅ **Class-specific insights** (references our discussions/demos)
- Example: "In Week 3's debate about whether affordances require inference, my skateboarding analysis supports Gibson's direct perception—I don't compute grindability; I perceive it directly through the rail's geometry."

✅ **Personal depth** (goes beyond generic examples)
- Example: "During yesterday's commute, I noticed X, which connects to our tau demo because..."

✅ **Critical thinking** (especially if AI was used)
- Example: "ChatGPT suggested that 'cyclists predict collision risk,' which contradicts Gibson's direct perception argument. Using Lee (1976) from our readings, I demonstrate that tau specifies time-to-contact without prediction."

**Criteria deemphasized:**
- Perfect grammar (clarity matters; perfection doesn't)
- Rigid five-paragraph structure (integration may require different organization)
- Exact word count (focus on complete ideas, not counting words)

---

### EXEMPLARS

**[To be added after first semester teaching this version]**

For now, here's what integration looks like vs. what it doesn't:

❌ **Poor integration (listing concepts separately):**
> "First, I'll discuss optic flow. The cyclist uses optic flow to see speed. Second, I'll discuss affordances. The cyclist perceives ride-ability affordances. Third, I'll discuss dynamic touch. The cyclist feels the bike through their hands."

✅ **Strong integration (concepts work together):**
> "The cyclist's perception of ride-ability (affordance) depends on both visual tau from the approaching curb AND haptic information from the bike's inertia tensor through the handlebars. When these information sources are coupled—optical expansion specifying approach while haptic resistance specifies the bike's maneuverability—the affordance of 'curb-jumpability' emerges. This wouldn't be perceivable through vision or touch alone."

## Paper 2: Coordination & Control (Weeks 6-7)

### PURPOSE

**Why this paper matters:**
You're shifting from "what information is available" (ecological) to "how behavior emerges and changes" (dynamical). The HKB model and synergy framework explain something profound: Complex, skilled behavior isn't centrally controlled—it self-organizes. Understanding this changes how you think about learning, skill, and breakdown under pressure.

**Connection to future work:**
These dynamical concepts will reappear in Paper 3 (social coordination uses the same HKB math) and your Research Proposal (many of you will test dynamical hypotheses). This is foundational theory for modern motor control research.

---

#### **Phase 3: AI-Enhanced Development (Optional - Strategy 7)**

**Same structure as Paper 1:**

1. **Use AI to generate analysis** (document the output)
2. **Critically evaluate** (what's right/wrong/missing)
3. **Human enhancement** (add class-specific insights, personal depth)
4. **AI Transparency Appendix** (if used)

**AI will likely struggle with:**
- Your personal experience of phase transitions
- Class-specific demos and discussions
- Video evidence from YOUR skill learning
- Nuanced understanding of attractors in YOUR context

**Your job:** Show what you bring beyond AI.

---

#### **Phase 4: Reflection Component (Required)**

**Metacognitive Prompts:**

## Paper 3: Modern Applications (Weeks 9, 13)

### PURPOSE

**Why this paper matters:**
You're now applying everything you've learned to cutting-edge questions: How do humans coordinate with each other? How do we coordinate with AI and robots? These questions matter for team performance, human-robot interaction design, and understanding trust in automated systems.

**Connection to future work:**
Many of you will design Research Proposals testing social coordination or human-machine teaming hypotheses. This paper prepares you for that. It also matters for your careers—you'll all work in teams and with AI systems.

- Specific student questions or insights (with names, if public)
- Debates or disagreements that emerged
- Unexpected demo results
- Memorable examples students generated
- Confusions or misconceptions that surfaced

**Use these to customize prompts** so they're genuinely AI-resistant (AI wasn't there!).

## Student-Facing Summary (For Syllabus/First Day)

**How Thought Papers Work in This Course:**

Unlike traditional papers with fixed prompts, our papers integrate concepts through **your class experiences**:

1. **Participate actively** in demos, discussions, and activities (Weeks 2-4, 6-7, 9 & 13)
2. **Specific prompts finalized after class activities** to ensure they reflect OUR discourse
3. **Your paper references specific class moments** AI wasn't present for
4. **Optional AI use** with critical evaluation and transparency
5. **Reflection required** on your learning process

**Why this approach?**
- Makes assignments meaningful (connected to your experience)
- Makes them AI-resistant (AI wasn't in our classroom)
- Teaches you to think like a researcher (integrating concepts in context)
- Develops AI literacy (if you choose to use it critically)

**Bottom line:** Your lived experience in this course IS your competitive advantage over AI.
