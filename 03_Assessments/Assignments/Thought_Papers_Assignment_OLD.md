# Thought Papers - DPA Spring 2026

## Overview

Thought papers are short analytical essays that connect course concepts to real-world phenomena. Unlike traditional response papers that merely summarize readings, thought papers require you to **apply** theoretical frameworks to analyze perception-action scenarios you encounter in daily life, sports, work, technology, and other domains.

## Topic Prompts

### **Topic 1: Dynamic Touch (Week 4) - Due Friday, Feb 13**

**Key Concepts:** Inertia tensor, rotational dynamics, perception through wielding, haptic invariants

**Choose ONE of the following prompts:**

#### **Prompt 1A: Tool Use & Expertise**
Choose a tool-based skill (e.g., tennis racket, hockey stick, surgical instrument, drumstick, writing stylus, cane). Describe how dynamic touch allows users to perceive object properties through wielding. How might the inertia tensor explain differences between novice and expert tool users? What happens when you switch to an unfamiliar tool (different weight distribution, length)?

#### **Prompt 1B: Prosthetics & Sensory Substitution**
Research a modern prosthetic limb or sensory substitution device (e.g., "The vOICe" visual-to-auditory, vibrotactile feedback systems). Using Turvey's dynamic touch framework, analyze: What haptic information might be preserved or lost? How could rotational dynamics inform better prosthetic design? Can the inertia tensor concept apply to non-biological systems?

#### **Prompt 1C: Sports Performance**
Analyze a sport where athletes wield implements (baseball bat, golf club, fencing foil). How does dynamic touch allow athletes to perceive sweet spots, balance points, or optimal striking zones? Use the inertia tensor concept to explain why professional athletes are so sensitive to equipment changes (e.g., adding grip tape, switching bat weight).

### **Topic 2: Coordination Dynamics (Week 6) - Due Friday, Feb 27**

**Key Concepts:** Phase transitions, HKB model, attractors, stability, self-organization, in-phase vs. anti-phase coordination

**Choose ONE of the following prompts:**

#### **Prompt 2A: Behavioral Phase Transitions**
Identify a behavior in your life that shows phase transition dynamics (e.g., sleep-wake cycles, study habits, exercise routines, social interaction patterns). Describe the stable "attractor states," what perturbations push you between states, and whether the system shows hysteresis (difficulty returning to original state). Does the HKB model's principles (frequency-driven instability) apply metaphorically?

#### **Prompt 2B: Learning & Skill Acquisition**
Choose a skill you've learned or are learning (musical instrument, language, athletic skill). Use coordination dynamics to analyze the learning process: What are the initial "attractor states" (stable but inefficient patterns)? How does practice create phase transitions to new, more skilled patterns? When does coordination "break down" under speed or pressure?

#### **Prompt 2C: Group Coordination Failures**
Analyze a scenario where group coordination fails (e.g., traffic jams, crowd panic, team miscommunication, group project dysfunction). Using phase transition concepts, explain: What was the intended stable pattern? What perturbation caused instability? Could the system have been stabilized differently? How might understanding attractor dynamics prevent coordination failures?

### **Topic 3: Social Coordination (Week 9) - Due Friday, Mar 27**

**Key Concepts:** Interpersonal synchrony, unintentional coordination, coupling strength, leadership/followership dynamics

**Choose ONE of the following prompts:**

#### **Prompt 3A: Unintentional Synchrony in Daily Life**
Observe and describe a case of unintentional interpersonal synchrony (e.g., gait synchronization while walking with a friend, speech rhythm matching in conversation, simultaneous gestures, synchronized laughter). Using Richardson et al.'s framework, analyze: What information coupled the individuals? Was the coordination symmetric (mutual) or asymmetric (leader-follower)? What happens when coupling is disrupted (e.g., one person gets a phone call)?

#### **Prompt 3B: Designed Coordination Systems**
Analyze a context where coordination is intentionally designed (e.g., orchestra, sports team, military drill, assembly line, surgical team). How is coupling strength manipulated to achieve synchrony? What role do leaders/conductors play in stabilizing coordination? How does the system handle perturbations (mistakes, delays)? Use social coordination dynamics to explain success or failure.

#### **Prompt 3C: Technology-Mediated Coordination**
Examine online/virtual coordination (e.g., video calls, online gaming, remote collaboration, virtual classes). Compare to face-to-face coordination using coupling strength concepts. What information sources are preserved or lost? How does latency (delay) affect synchrony? Do Richardson's principles still apply in virtual environments?

### **Topic 4: Ecological vs. Predictive Processing (Week 11) - Due Friday, Apr 10**

**Key Concepts:** Direct perception vs. inference, prediction error minimization, internal models, ecological information, the "great debate"

**Choose ONE of the following prompts:**

#### **Prompt 4A: Perception in Expertise**
Choose a domain of expertise (e.g., radiologists reading X-rays, sommelier tasting wine, mechanics diagnosing car sounds, chess grandmasters seeing patterns). Analyze this expertise through BOTH frameworks: (1) Ecological: What invariant information do experts detect directly? (2) Predictive: How do internal models/predictions shape perception? Which framework better explains expertise, or do both contribute?

#### **Prompt 4B: Illusions & Misperception**
Select a perceptual illusion or common misperception (e.g., visual illusions, phantom limb sensations, pareidolia - seeing faces in objects, mishearing lyrics). Explain how the ecological and predictive processing frameworks would account for this phenomenon differently. Which framework provides a better explanation, and why? Can the two be reconciled?

#### **Prompt 4C: Embodied Cognition & Action**
Analyze a perception-action task (e.g., catching a ball, parking a car, navigating a crowd, reaching for objects). Compare explanations: Ecological would emphasize direct pickup of information (tau, optic flow). Predictive Processing would emphasize forward models and prediction error. Which framework better captures the real-time, embodied nature of the task? Defend your position.

### **Topic 5: Human-Machine Teaming (Week 13) - Due Friday, Apr 24**

**Key Concepts:** Asymmetric coordination, rigid vs. flexible coupling, trust as stability parameter, sensory substitution, ecological interface design

**Choose ONE of the following prompts:**

#### **Prompt 5A: AI Assistants & Coordination**
Analyze your experience with an AI system (e.g., ChatGPT, Siri, autocomplete, recommendation algorithms, GPS navigation). Using social coordination dynamics: How is the human-AI coupling structured? Is it symmetric (mutual adaptation) or asymmetric (one-sided)? What happens when the AI makes errors—does trust act as a "stability parameter"? How might coupling strength be adjusted for better teaming?

#### **Prompt 5B: Autonomous Systems in High-Stakes Contexts**
Choose a high-stakes human-machine team (e.g., self-driving cars, surgical robots, automated trading systems, drone operation, air traffic control). Apply coordination dynamics: What kind of coupling exists? How is control shared or delegated? When coordination breaks down, what are the consequences? Use ecological psychology to propose design improvements (better information, tighter coupling, etc.).

#### **Prompt 5C: Prosthetics & Extended Embodiment**
Research advanced prosthetics or brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Using dynamic touch and coordination dynamics concepts: How does the user perceive through the device? What information couples the user and prosthetic? Is the coupling rigid or flexible? How might devices be designed to create tighter, more natural coordination (invoking ecological interface design principles)?

## Tips for Success

### **Choosing Your Topics**
- **Spread them out:** Don't do all 4 papers in the first half of the semester
- **Play to your strengths:** Choose topics that connect to your interests or experiences
- **Skip your weakest:** Use the flexibility to avoid topics you find most challenging

### **Selecting a Prompt**
- **Pick scenarios you know well:** The best applications come from deep familiarity
- **Consider available examples:** Some prompts require research; others draw on experience
- **Match your interests:** Sports fans might prefer sports prompts; tech enthusiasts might prefer AI prompts

### **Writing Strong Applications**
- **Be specific:** "I use tools" is weak. "When I switched from a wooden to aluminum bat in softball..." is strong.
- **Go beyond description:** Don't just describe the scenario—analyze it through the conceptual lens
- **Make connections explicit:** "This demonstrates dynamic touch because..." not "Dynamic touch is relevant here."

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- ❌ Summarizing the reading without applying it
- ❌ Choosing a vague or generic example
- ❌ Failing to explain the concept before applying it
- ❌ Not citing course readings
- ❌ Going over or under the page limit (2-3 pages is firm)
