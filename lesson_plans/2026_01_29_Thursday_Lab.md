# Lab Guide: Ecological Optics & The Moving Room
**Date:** Thursday, Jan 29 (Week 3)

## 🎯 Lab Objectives
1.  **Experience:** Feel the power of **Optic Flow** to control balance (Visual Proprioception).
2.  **Define:** Formally define the **Ambient Optic Array** and **Global Radial Outflow**.
3.  **Test:** Replicate the logic of Savelsbergh's "Deflating Ball" to prove we use **Tau**.
4.  **Debate:** Discuss the "Great Debate" of Flow vs. Direction (Warren vs. Rushton).

## 🏃 I. The Experience: Visual Proprioception (20 min)
*   **Paper:** **Lee & Aronson (1974) - Visual proprioceptive control of standing in human infants.**
*   **The Concept:** We usually think vision is for seeing *objects*. But it's also for seeing *the self* (proprioception).
*   **The "Moving Room" Simulation:**
    *   *Setup:* Use a large screen projector (or VR headsets if available).
    *   *Stimulus:* A "room" (or tunnel pattern) that suddenly looms *forward*.
    *   *Prediction:* If the walls move forward, your eyes detect **Global Expansion**. Your brain thinks *you* are falling backward.
    *   *Reaction:* You should sway *forward* to compensate.
    *   *Discussion:* Why did you sway? You clearly felt your feet on the stable floor. Why did Vision overrule Touch? (Answer: Vision is the "Boss" sense for self-motion).

## 📐 II. The Theory: The Geometry of Information (30 min)
*   **The Ambient Optic Array:**
    *   Contrast **Radiant Light** (Physics/Photons) vs. **Ambient Light** (Ecology/Structure).
    *   *The Point of Observation:* Light converges to a point. It has structure (texture density, angles).
*   **Global Radial Outflow:**
    *   Draw the vector field.
    *   *Expansion* = Approach (or backward sway).
    *   *Contraction* = Retreat (or forward sway).
    *   *Focus of Expansion (FOE):* Specifies your heading.

## ⚾ III. The Evidence: Grasping Tau (20 min)
*   **Paper:** **Savelsbergh, et al. (1991) - Grasping tau.**
*   **The "Deflating Ball" Logic:**
    *   *The "Cognitive" Hypothesis:* We calculate $Time = Distance / Velocity$.
    *   *The "Ecological" Hypothesis:* We use $Tau (\tau) = Inverse Rate of Expansion$.
    *   *The Test:* Throw a ball that *deflates* (gets smaller) as it approaches.
        *   **Cognitive Prediction:** Size change doesn't matter for D/V. Catching should be normal.
        *   **Ecological Prediction:** Deflating opposes expansion. The ball looks like it's approaching *slower* than it is.
        *   **Result:** People catch **LATE**. They relied on the optical variable ($\tau$), not the physical reality.

## ⚔️ IV. The Debate: How do we walk? (15 min)
*   **Paper:** **Warren et al. (2001) - Optic flow is used to control human walking.**
*   **Warren (Flow) vs. Rushton (Direction):**
    *   *Rushton's Prisms:* Walking to a target with prisms. If we used flow, we'd go straight. We curve. (Evidence for Direction).
    *   *Warren's VR:* In a textured forest, we use Flow. In an empty room, we use Direction.
    *   *Conclusion:* The system is flexible. It weights information based on the environment (Niche).
