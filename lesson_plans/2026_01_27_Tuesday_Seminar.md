# Seminar Guide: Action vs. Perception & The Axioms
**Date:** Tuesday, Jan 27 (Week 3)
**Note:** Adjusting for cancelled class on Jan 22. "Action vs. Perception" Lab integrated into today's session.

## 🎯 Lesson Objectives
1.  **Experience:** Demonstrate the dissociation between conscious perception and motor control (Ebbinghaus Demo).
2.  **Consolidate:** Review the logical pitfalls of the "Standard Story" (Homunculus).
3.  **Define:** Establish the core axioms of Ecological Realism (B&W Ch 3).
4.  **Metaphorize:** Use the Polar Planimeter to ground "Direct Perception" (B&W Ch 4).
5.  **Prime:** Introduce "Ambient Light" for Thursday.

## 🔬 I. The Lab: Action vs. Perception (15-20 min)
**Context:** "Last week we claimed the 'Standard Story' fails. Today we test it."

**Student Packet:** `Week_03_Lab_Packet_Ebbinghaus_Suite.md` (distributed at start of class)

### Activity 1: Computerized Susceptibility Test (5-7 min)

**Setup:**
- Students complete computerized Ebbinghaus test (Python script: `99_Demos/ebbinghaus_illusion/ebbinghaus_illusion.py`)
- Multiple trials with varying circle sizes and surrounding contexts
- Computer calculates individual **susceptibility score** (% of trials where context influenced judgment)

**Procedure:**
1. Students make predictions about their own susceptibility and class average
2. Complete the computerized test (F = left bigger, J = right bigger, Space = equal)
3. Record susceptibility score
4. Pool class data on board

**Expected Result:**
- Class average: 50-70% susceptibility
- Wide individual variation
- **Key takeaway:** Even when you know it's an illusion, you're still fooled

### Activity 2: Oscillatory Fitts Task (10-12 min)

**Setup:**
- Three tapping surface conditions (both targets have matching context):
  - **Condition A:** No surrounding circles
  - **Condition B:** Both targets surrounded by large circles (targets should look smaller)
  - **Condition C:** Both targets surrounded by small circles (targets should look larger)
- Two target sizes: 2 cm and 3 cm diameter
- Students complete 6 conditions × 3 trials = 18 trials total

**Task:**
- Rapidly alternate tapping between two targets (10 oscillations per trial)
- Partner records: Total movement time and errors

**The Twist:**
- **Expected result:** Movement time and accuracy are **equal across all context conditions**
- The illusion that affected judgment (Activity 1) does NOT affect continuous movement
- Physical size (2cm vs 3cm) DOES matter (Fitts' Law), but illusory size (context) does NOT

### The Puzzle (Transition to Discussion):

**Say:**
> "Let's review what just happened:
> - **Perception Test:** Average susceptibility was [X]%. The surrounding circles fooled your conscious judgment.
> - **Fitts Task:** Your movements were equally fast and accurate across all context conditions. The illusion had no effect.
>
> **The Question:** If your brain built a 'Mental Image' to guide both perception and action, and that image was wrong (illusion)... **how did your movements stay accurate?**"

## 🔦 II. The Prime: Ecological Optics (10-15 min)
**Format: Whiteboard Only (No Slides)**
*   **Goal:** Create intrigue. "How does light carry information without a picture?"

### The Napkin Sketch
1.  **Draw "Radiant Light" (Physics):**
    *   *Sketch:* A sun/bulb emitting rays **outward** in all directions.
    *   *Narrative:* "Physics cares about the *source* and energy. Light radiates out. It's chaotic. This is just photons hitting atoms."
2.  **Draw "Ambient Light" (Ecology):**
    *   *Sketch:* A stick figure head. Draw lines **converging inward** to the eye from the walls, floor, and objects.
    *   *Narrative:* "Ecology cares about the *point of observation*. Light converges **in**. Because the room has structure (texture), the light array has structure (angles, density)."
3.  **The Hook:**
    *   "This isn't an image. It's an **array**. On Thursday, we'll prove that this structure tells you *exactly* when you're going to hit the wall—without your brain doing a single calculation."

## 💬 Discussion Questions: Axioms & Planimeters (35-40 min)

### Question 1: The Planimeter Challenge (Apply Axiom 6: Direct Perception)
**Setup:** "The Polar Planimeter measures *area* without measuring length or width. It doesn't compute—it resonates with geometry."

**Question:** In the Ebbinghaus activities, your **perception** was fooled by the surrounding circles (susceptibility test), but your **movements** ignored the illusion (Fitts task). Using the Planimeter metaphor, what "higher-order property" was your motor system *directly detecting* that your judgment task missed? Why can't we just say "the motor system is smarter"?

**Goal:** Push beyond "two visual systems" to *information specificity*—the motor system detected action-relevant variables (target location/size for movement control), not size-in-context.

**🎯 CRITICAL: This Question IS Your "Pivot" Moment**

This discussion replaces the need for a separate lecture on "two visual systems." Through facilitation, guide students to discover:

**The Trap (Two Visual Systems):**
- Students will likely say: "The hand is smarter" or "The unconscious system got it right"
- This splits the organism: Conscious (fooled) vs. Unconscious (accurate)

**Your Facilitation Move - Don't Split the Animal:**
- **If students say "the motor system is smarter":** Ask: "So the motor system has its own brain? Where is that brain located? And if the motor system can detect the real size, why can't the perceptual system?"
- **If students invoke "two visual systems":** Acknowledge: "That's the traditional explanation (Milner & Goodale). But does it really solve the problem, or just relabel it?"

**The Ecological Alternative (Guide Them Here):**
- **Don't split the *animal*; analyze the *information***
- **Task Specificity:**
  - **Judgment task ("Which is bigger?"):** Detected *Contrast Relations* (center vs. surround). You weren't "fooled"—you correctly perceived the contrast.
  - **Movement task ("Tap accurately"):** Detected *Action-Relevant Properties* (target locations and sizes for movement control).
- **Key Insight:** Not two *systems* (Smart vs. Dumb), but two *variables* (Contrast vs. Action Properties). The organism organizes to detect whatever information specifies the current goal.

**Whiteboard Aid:** Draw two columns:
| Judgment Task                                      | Movement Task                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal: Compare sizes                                | Goal: Tap targets accurately                        |
| Information: Contrast (center/surround)            | Information: Target properties for movement control |
| Result: Illusion works (correct contrast detected) | Result: Movements accurate (illusion ignored)       |

**Expected Outcome:** By end of Q1, students should grasp that the "mystery" dissolves when we stop asking "Which system is right?" and start asking "What information does each task require?"

### Question 2: Axiom 3 (Organisms are Active) vs. Static Illusions
**Setup:** "Axiom 3 says organisms are *active*, not passive. Movement structures information."

**Question:** The Ebbinghaus illusion works in a static 2D image. What would happen if you could **walk around** a 3D version of the illusion, or **rotate** the object? Would the illusion persist? What does this tell us about the *type* of information pickup the Standard Story focuses on versus what Ecological Psychology values?

**Goal:** Highlight that illusions exploit *impoverished* contexts. Real-world perception involves active exploration, which generates richer, unambiguous information.

---

### Question 3: Axiom 9 (No Central Executive) and the Homunculus Problem
**Setup:** "Axiom 9: There is no 'mini-person in the head' interpreting sensory data."

**Question:** If your brain **built a mental picture** of the Ebbinghaus circles (the Standard Story), and that picture was *wrong* (the illusion), who or what would need to "correct" it so your hand could grasp accurately? How does the ecological solution (direct pickup of graspability) avoid this infinite regress?

**Goal:** Force confrontation with the Homunculus Problem. If representations need interpreters, who interprets the interpreter?

---

### Question 4: Physics-Based vs. Action-Based Variables (Bridge to Ambient Light)
**Setup:** "Axiom 8 says perception uses *action-based* variables (graspable, climbable), not *physics-based* ones (centimeters, wavelengths)."

**Question:** In the Ebbinghaus susceptibility test, we asked you to **compare sizes** (physics-based: "Which is bigger?"). But in the Fitts task, your motor system didn't need to know "size"—it needed to know **where to move and how precisely**. On Thursday, we'll argue that light itself carries *structure* (angles, flow, texture gradients), not just "brightness." What might it mean for light to specify an *affordance* (like "tap-able target") instead of just triggering a sensation?

**Goal:** Prime students for Ecological Optics. Shift from "light as stimulus" to "light as structured information."

### Facilitation Notes

**Timing (35-40 min total):**
- Q1: 10-12 min (This IS the "pivot"—most critical discussion; connects demo to theory)
- Q2: 7 min (Builds on Q1, introduces movement)
- Q3: 8 min (Hardest—may need scaffolding)
- Q4: 7 min (Transition to Thursday)

**Flow:**
- Q1 should feel like students are "solving the puzzle" from the demo
- Q2-Q4 deepen the theoretical framework established in Q1
- Use the whiteboard table in Q1 as an anchor you can reference throughout

**If Q3 Stalls:** Ask: "If I build a robot that has a camera (eyes) and a 'brain' that builds a 3D model from the image... what part of the robot decides when the model is 'good enough' to act on? And what if *that* part is also just software—who checks *it*?"

**After Q4:** Use your whiteboard to sketch Radiant vs. Ambient Light (from Section II) as the bridge to Thursday.
