# Task Plan: Reorganize Dynamics of Perception & Action Course Folder

## Goal
Standardize the "Dynamics of Perception & Action" folder structure to match the "History Systems Psychology" convention.

## Phases
- [x] Phase 1: Analyze and Map (Inventory current contents vs. Target structure)
- [x] Phase 2: Create Target Directory Structure
- [x] Phase 3: Move/Organize Files (Execute the migration)
- [x] Phase 4: Clean up and Verify

## Key Questions
1. Where should `nikita_course`, `UCedu_DPA`, and `analysis` go? (Resolved: Archives and Design/Analysis)
2. Should `readings` go to `04_Resources` or stay within `02_Modules` context? (Resolved: 04_Resources)
3. Where do `activities` fit? (Resolved: 02_Modules)

## Decisions Made
- [Decision]: Adopt the 00-06 numbering convention from HSP.
- [Decision]: Old course archives go to `04_Resources/Archives`.

## Status
**Completed** - Reorganization finished. Validated structure matches HSP convention.
