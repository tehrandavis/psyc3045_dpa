# Activity Alignment Audit: Week 13

**Activity:** Trust Fall with a Robot
**Key Concepts:** Ecological Interface Design (EID), Trust, HMT.

**Assigned Readings:**
1.  Blau & Wagman (2022), Chapter 13.
2.  Selected HMT Papers (TBD).

**Alignment Status:** ⚠️ **DEPENDENT ON SELECTION**

**Analysis:**
-   **Concept Match:** B&W Ch 13 covers EID.
-   **Gap:** "Trust" as a dynamical parameter is not deeply covered in B&W.
-   **Recommendation:** Ensure the "Selected HMT Papers" include something on trust dynamics (e.g., Hoff & Bashir, or a specific EID paper) to support the "Trust Fall" aspect.
