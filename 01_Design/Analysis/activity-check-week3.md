# Activity Alignment Audit: Week 3

**Activity:** The Great Stair Lab (Field Trip)
**Key Concepts:** Body-Scaling, Intrinsic Metrics ($R/L$), Warren's Number (0.26 / 0.88), Affordances.

**Assigned Readings:**
1.  Gibson (1979), Chapter 8 (Theory of Affordances).
2.  Blau & Wagman (2022), Chapter 5 (Affordances).
3.  **Optional:** Warren (1984).

**Alignment Status:** ⚠️ **RISK OF ABSTRACTION**

**Analysis:**
-   **Concept Match:** Gibson and B&W Ch 5 cover the *theory* of affordances perfectly.
-   **The Gap:** The activity is a replication of **Warren (1984)**. Students are asked to test specific predictions ($R/L = 0.88$ for max climbable).
-   **Issue:** While B&W Ch 5 likely summarizes Warren, the deep appreciation of the *method* comes from the Warren paper, which is listed as **Optional**.
-   **Risk:** Students might treat the numbers as "magic constants" rather than understanding how Warren derived them.

**Recommendation:**
-   Move **Warren (1984)** from "Optional" to "Required" (or strongly recommended) for this week, OR ensure the mini-lecture on Tuesday explicitly breaks down Warren's methodology.
