# Activity Alignment Audit: Week 1

**Activity:** The Robot vs. The Outfielder (Design Firm)
**Key Concepts:** Computational Load, Poverty of Stimulus, Optical Acceleration Cancellation (OAC).

**Assigned Readings:**
1.  Blau & Wagman (2022), Chapters 1–2 (Intro, Theory & History).

**Alignment Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL MISALIGNMENT**

**Analysis:**
-   **Concept Match:** The readings cover the broad "Computational vs. Ecological" debate and "Poverty of the Stimulus" (Ch 1-2). Students will be prepared to argue the *philosophy*.
-   **Missing Technical Detail:** The activity explicitly uses **Optical Acceleration Cancellation (OAC)** as the "Ecological Solution." OAC is typically an "Ecological Optics" concept (Chapter 6, assigned Week 2).
-   **Risk:** Students may understand *why* computation is bad, but not *how* OAC works mathematically/optically based *only* on Ch 1-2.

**Recommendation:**
-   Instructor must teach OAC on the whiteboard *during* the session (as the "Ecological Pivot"). Do not expect students to know Chapman's strategy from the reading alone.
