# Activity Alignment Audit: Week 2

**Activity:** Visualizing Tau (Video Analysis)
**Key Concepts:** Time-to-Contact, Tau ($\tau$), Optic Expansion, Direct Perception.

**Assigned Readings:**
1.  Gibson (1979), Chapter 1.
2.  Blau & Wagman (2022), Chapter 6 (Ecological Optics).

**Alignment Status:** ✅ **ALIGNED**

**Analysis:**
-   **Concept Match:** Blau & Wagman Chapter 6 ("Ecological Optics") is the primary textbook source for optic flow and Tau. It covers the geometry of expansion.
-   **Note:** The classic paper **Lee (1976)** is listed as "Optional" in Week 3, but the concept is central here.
-   **Verdict:** The textbook provides sufficient background for the activity. The "Optional" Lee paper is not strictly necessary if Ch 6 is read.
