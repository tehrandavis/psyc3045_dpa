# 📅 Schedule Review & Analysis: Dynamics of Perception & Action (S26)

## 🚦 Executive Summary
The schedule follows a rigid **"Primer-Reveal" cadence** (Thursday Activity → Weekend Reading → Tuesday Seminar). This structure is pedagogically strong but creates specific pressure points, particularly when "heavy" readings coincide with major deliverable due dates.

**Status:** Generally solid, but Weeks 5, 8, and 12 require careful management.

## 🗓️ Weekly Flow & Pain Points

### Part I: Ecological Foundations (The Physics of Information)
*   **Week 1 (Jan 13/15):** Intro & Logic Trap. *Status: Complete.*
*   **Week 2 (Jan 20/22):** Direct Perception & Tau.
    *   *Conflict:* First real reading quiz (Tue). Need to ensure "Tau" activity (Thu) clearly links to the *next* week's reading on Optics.
*   **Week 3 (Jan 27/29):** Ecological Optics & Stair Lab.
    *   *Note:* Field Trip week (Stair Lab). Logistics critical.
*   **Week 4 (Feb 3/5):** Affordances & Wielding.
    *   *Load:* Thought Paper 1 is released.

### Part II: The Dynamical Turn (The Mathematics of Order)
*   **Week 5 (Feb 10/12):** Dynamic Touch & Haptics.
    *   **🔴 HIGH LOAD:** Thought Paper 1 DUE + Curation Pitch DUE on Friday Feb 13.
    *   *Risk:* Students may skimp on the "Mapping Attractors" activity (Thu) to finish papers.
*   **Week 6 (Feb 17/19):** Dynamical Systems 101.
    *   *Content Warning:* Heavy conceptual week (Attractors, Phase Space). The "Finger Wiggling" activity is simple but the theory is dense.
*   **Week 7 (Feb 24/26):** Coordination Dynamics (HKB).
    *   *Load:* Thought Paper 2 released.
*   **Week 8 (Mar 3/5):** Degrees of Freedom & Review.
    *   **🔴 CHECK-IN:** Lab Dossier Check-in (Thu) replaces Midterm. Thought Paper 2 DUE (Fri).
    *   *Risk:* Major grading bottleneck for instructor.

### Part III: The Modern Synthesis (Cognitive & Social)
*   **Week 9 (Mar 10/12):** Social Coordination.
    *   *Load:* Curation Artifact List DUE (Fri).
*   **Week 10 (Mar 16-22):** 🏖️ **SPRING BREAK**
*   **Week 11 (Mar 24/26):** Landscape of Affordances.
    *   *Note:* Return from break. Good "reset" topic.
*   **Week 12 (Mar 31/Apr 2):** The Great Debate (Eco vs. PP).
    *   **⚠️ COMPLEXITY:** The "Council of Science" roleplay (Thu) requires significant student prep.
*   **Week 13 (Apr 7/9):** Neuroscience (Cisek).
    *   *Load:* Curation Lesson Plan DUE (Fri).

### Part IV: Applications
*   **Week 14 (Apr 14/16):** Human-Machine Teaming.
    *   *Load:* Thought Paper 3 released. "Trust Fall" activity needs robot/tech setup.
*   **Week 15 (Apr 21/23):** Student Presentations.
    *   *Deliverable:* Thought Paper 3 DUE (Fri).

## 🚩 Inconsistencies & Action Items

1.  **Reading Load Imbalance:**
    *   **Week 2-4:** Heavy reading (Book + Gibson Chapters).
    *   **Week 5:** Heavy reading (Book + Turvey) coincides with **Double Deadline** (Paper + Pitch).
    *   *Action:* Consider lightening Week 5 reading or moving Curation Pitch to Week 6.

2.  **Activity Prep Gaps:**
    *   **Week 14:** "Trust Fall with a Robot" is listed but we have no activity guide or equipment list.
    *   **Week 12:** "Council of Science" needs specific role sheets created *before* Week 11 so students can prep.

3.  **Assessment Alignment:**
    *   **Lab Dossier:** We need to explicitly tell students *what* goes in it during Weeks 1-4 so they don't scramble in Week 8.
    *   *Action:* Create a "Lab Dossier One-Pager" to hand out immediately.

4.  **Missing "Modern" Readings:**
    *   Weeks 9, 10, 11, 12 still list "Missing Papers" in the roadmap. These need to be sourced ASAP.

## 📝 Recommendations
*   **Week 5 Relief:** Move "Curation Check-in 1 (Topic Pitch)" to **Monday of Week 6**? This clears the weekend for the Thought Paper.
*   **Dossier Template:** Provide a physical or digital folder structure for the Lab Dossier now.
