# Facilitator Script: Week 7 - Dynamical Systems 101

**Topic:** Attractors & Phase Space (Blau & Wagman Ch 14 + Thelen & Smith)
**Goal:** Teach the language of change. Define **Attractor**, **Repeller**, and **Phase Transition**.

---

## 🕒 Activity 1: Warm-up - "The Valley Debrief" (00:00 - 00:15)

**Setup:** Refer to last Thursday's **"Mapping Attractors"** Lab.

**🗣️ The Hook:**
> "On Thursday, you fought your own body. You tried to walk slow/fast, and it felt like climbing a hill.
> We called that 'The Valley'.
>
> Today, we give it a mathematical name: **The Attractor**.
>
> **Question:** If your walking speed is an Attractor, what happens if I push you? (You return to it).
> **Question:** What if I push you *too* hard? (You stumble/switch gaits)."

## 🕒 Activity 2: Deep Dive - "Phase Space" (00:15 - 00:35)

**🗣️ The Set-Up:**
> "Dynamical Systems Theory (DST) doesn't use standard graphs (Time on x-axis).
> It uses **Phase Space**. It maps the *state* of the system."

**✍️ The Prompt (Whiteboard):**
> "Draw a Pendulum.
> **x-axis:** Position (Angle).
> **y-axis:** Velocity.
>
> Trace the path of a swinging pendulum.
> (It's a circle/spiral).
>
> **The Point:** A stable behavior looks like a closed loop (Limit Cycle) in Phase Space.
> This is how we map 'Stability'."

## 🕒 Activity 3: Core Activity - "The Stability Landscape" (00:35 - 01:00)

**Setup:** Visualize the "Ball in the Valley" metaphor.

**Step 1: Point Attractor**
> "A marble in a bowl. It always settles at the bottom.
> Example: Reaching for a coffee cup. Your hand always ends up at the cup."

**Step 2: Limit Cycle Attractor**
> "A planet orbiting a star. It never stops, but it never leaves the path.
> Example: Walking. Breathing."

**Step 3: Repeller**
> "The top of a hill. You can balance a ball there, but if you breathe on it, it runs away.
> Example: Trying to walk *exactly* at the transition speed between walk/run."

## 🕒 Activity 4: Forward Link - "Bifurcation" (01:00 - 01:20)

**🗣️ The Tease:**
> "So far, we've assumed the Landscape is fixed.
> But what if the Landscape *changes*?
> What if the Valley disappears?
>
> This is a **Phase Transition** (or Bifurcation).
> It's how new behaviors emerge."

**The Bridge:**
> "On Thursday, we are going to break your fingers.
> Not literally. But we are going to force a Phase Transition in your hands.
> We will see an Attractor disappear in real time."

## 🕒 Activity 5: Closing (01:20 - 01:30)

**Minute Paper:**
> "Define **'Self-Organization'** using the marble-in-a-bowl metaphor. Who moves the marble?"
