# Week 2 Thursday: Instructor Guide
## "The Two Visual Systems" - Action vs. Perception

**Date:** Thursday, January 23, 2026
**Duration:** 75 minutes
**Class Size:** 5 students
**Mode:** Primer (Data & Experience)

---

## Session Overview

### Pedagogical Goal
Students will experience the dissociation between **Vision for Perception** (what we see) and **Vision for Action** (what we do). They will discover that while their conscious perception can be fooled by context (illusions), their motor system is often immune because it uses different information (absolute metrics).

### Key Insight
"Your eye lies, but your hand tells the truth." (Action-scaled information is robust).

**Materials Needed**

**Activity:**
- [ ] Printed Ebbinghaus Illusion mats (Large circles vs. Small circles context).
- [ ] Poker chips (or 3D printed disks) of identical size to place in the centers.
- [ ] A Ruler (for the Estimation task).
- [ ] Blindfold (optional, for occlusion varations).

**Empirical Snapshot:**
- [ ] **Haffenden (2001)** - Figures 1 & 2 (Grip Aperture vs. Manual Estimation).

## Detailed Timeline

### 0:00-0:15 | Field Notes (Standard Opening)
**Routine:** Round-robin share
**Prompt:** "From your 'Real World Challenge': Give me one example where your computer/robot failed, but YOU succeeded. What did you do that the robot couldn't?"

---

### 0:15-0:45 | Part 1: The Activity (The Mystery)
**Goal:** Generate "Messy Data" showing the conflict.

**Setup:**
Place the poker chips in the center of the Ebbinghaus illusion mats.

**Protocol A: The Conscious Estimate (Perception)**
1.  Students look at the two chips (surrounded by small vs. large circles).
2.  **Task:** "Open your thumb and index finger to MATCH the size of the chip on the left."
3.  **Measurement:** Partner measures the gap between fingers with a ruler. Record in mm.
4.  Repeat for the chip on the right.
5.  **Prediction:** The gap should be wider for the "small circle" context (illusion of largeness).

**Protocol B: The Action (Grasping)**
1.  **Task:** "Reach out and pick up the chip on the left. Do it naturally, fast."
2.  **Measurement:** Partner watches the hand. Does the grip aperture look different? (Hard to measure without mocap, but focus on the *success* of the grasp. Did they fumble? No.)
3.  **Variation:** Reach out to touch the edges. Is the movement accurate?

**Data Collection:**
*   Compare the "Estimated Size" (Task A) vs. "Actual Size" (Reality).
*   Calculate the "Illusion Magnitude" (Error).

### 0:45-0:65 | Part 2: The Empirical Snapshot (The Evidence)
**Goal:** Validate their experience with "Official Science."

**The Pivot:**
"You all felt the illusion in Task A. Your fingers lied. But when you reached in Task B, you didn't miss. Why?"

**The Artifact:**
*   **Paper:** Haffenden, Schiff, & Goodale (2001).
*   **Figure 2:** Show the graph.
    *   *Left Bars (Estimate):* Big difference (Illusion works).
    *   *Right Bars (Grasp):* Flat line (Illusion fails).

**Discussion:**
*   "Look at the 'Grasp' bars. The hand didn't care about the circles. It only cared about the chip."
*   "Why does the hand know the truth when the eye sees a lie?" (Intro: Action-specificity).

---

### 0:65-0:75 | Part 3: Synthesis & Assignment
**Goal:** File the Dossier & Prime the Reading.

**Lab Worksheet:**
*   Plot your Class Data (Estimation Error vs. Grasp Success).
*   Reflection: "If the 'Retinal Image' is ambiguous (illusion), how did your hand find the true size?"

**Reading Assignment (For Tuesday):**
*   **Read:** Haffenden (2001) - Focus on the Intro and Figures.
*   **Read:** Blau & Wagman Ch 6 (Ecological Optics) - The theory of *why* light carries truthful information.

## Post-Session Notes
*   Did the manual estimation show the illusion? (Usually robust).
*   Did they buy the "Grasping is immune" argument without mocap data?
