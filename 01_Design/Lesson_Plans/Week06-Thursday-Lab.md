# Week 6 Thursday: Instructor Guide
## "Mapping Your Attractors" - Habits & Stability

**Date:** Thursday, February 19, 2026
**Duration:** 75 minutes
**Class Size:** 5 students
**Mode:** Primer (Data & Experience)

---

## Session Overview

### Pedagogical Goal
Students will experience the concept of an **Attractor** (a stable state of a system) not as a mathematical abstraction, but as a physical resistance to change. They will map the stability of their own coordination patterns (e.g., walking speed, pendulum swinging).

### Key Insight
"You don't 'choose' your walk. Your body falls into it. It's a gravity well."

---

**Materials Needed**

**Activity:**
- [ ] Metronomes (or a phone app) set to different BPM.
- [ ] A long space for walking.
- [ ] Two handheld pendulums (simple rods/strings with weights).

**Empirical Snapshot:**
- [ ] **Thelen & Smith (1994)** - The "Potential Landscape" diagram (Ball in a valley).
- [ ] **Holt et al. (1995)** - Preferred Walking Speed graphs (U-shaped energy curve).

## Detailed Timeline

### 0:00-0:15 | Field Notes (Standard Opening)
**Routine:** Round-robin share
**Prompt:** "What 'habit' did you fight this week? Did you try to change your gait? Your posture? Did it feel like fighting gravity?"

---

### 0:15-0:45 | Part 1: The Activity (The Mystery)
**Goal:** Generate "Messy Data" on Stability.

**Protocol: The Comfortable Walk**
1.  **Task:** "Walk up and down the hall. Find your groove."
2.  **Measure:** Count the cadence (Steps per Minute). Record it.
3.  **Perturbation:** "Now walk 20% slower." "Now walk 20% faster."
4.  **Rating:** "Rate the effort (1-10)."
5.  **Result:** The "Preferred" speed feels effortless. Deviating feels like work.

**Protocol: The Pendulum Swing**
1.  **Task:** Hold a pendulum. Swing it.
2.  **Observation:** It wants to swing at one frequency (Resonant Frequency).
3.  **Forcing:** Try to force it to swing faster. It fights you.
4.  **Insight:** Your leg is a pendulum. Your walk is a resonance.

### 0:45-0:65 | Part 2: The Empirical Snapshot (The Evidence)
**Goal:** Validate their experience with "Official Science."

**The Pivot:**
"You felt the 'groove'. Scientists call that an **Attractor**."

**The Artifact: Thelen & Smith (1994)**
*   **Show the Landscape:** Draw a ball in a valley.
    *   **Valley Bottom:** The Attractor (Preferred Speed).
    *   **Slopes:** The resistance you felt when speeding up/slowing down.
    *   **Depth:** How stable the habit is.
*   **The Energy Cost:** Show Holt's graph. Oxygen consumption is lowest at the resonant frequency.

**Discussion:**
*   "Why is it hard to break a habit? Because you have to climb out of the valley."

---

### 0:65-0:75 | Part 3: Synthesis & Assignment
**Goal:** File the Dossier & Prime the Reading.

**Lab Worksheet:**
*   Draw your own "Walking Landscape." Where is the valley?
*   Define "Attractor" in terms of stability/energy.

**Reading Assignment (For Tuesday):**
*   **Read:** Blau & Wagman Ch 14 (Dynamical Systems).
*   **Read:** Thelen & Smith (1994) (Dynamic Systems Approach).
*   "Read the math behind the valley."

## Post-Session Notes
*   Did the metronome help force them out of their comfort zone?
*   Do they understand "Stability" vs "Inability"?
