Assess learning outcomes in a 4‑student perception–action seminar by aligning a small set of clear outcomes with frequent, low‑stakes checks plus a couple of richer summative tasks.[1][2]

***

## 1. Define 3–4 concrete learning outcomes

Use action verbs and make them observable.[3][1]

Examples for perception–action:
- Explain and apply key concepts (e.g., optic flow, tau, affordances) to real‑world tasks.  
- Analyze perceptual information available in a given action scenario and predict behavior.  
- Design and critique simple perception–action experiments.  
- Communicate and justify theoretical positions (e.g., ecological vs. computational) in discussion and writing.

***

## 2. Ongoing formative assessment (every class)

These double as activities and assessments, which is ideal in seminars.[4][5]

**a. Structured discussion + quick writes**  
- Use 2–3 minute “minute papers” at start or end of class:  
  - “What information does the visual system use in [today’s demo] and why?”  
- Skim for misconceptions to address next time; grade for completion or with a simple 0/1/2 rubric (missing / partial / strong).[2][6]

**b. Concept maps over time**  
- A few times per term, ask them to draw a concept map linking perception–action constructs (optic flow, affordances, constraints, etc.).  
- Keep early and late maps and score with a simple rubric (number of accurate links, presence of cross‑links, use of examples).[6]

**c. Observation sheets during hands‑on activities**  
- For afffordance or balance demos, have each student complete a short worksheet: predictions, observations, explanation.  
- Review to see if they can:  
  - Identify information variables.  
  - Connect to theory (e.g., body‑scaled affordances).  
- This is both practice and evidence of learning.[7]

**d. Question creation**  
- Occasionally assign: “Write one exam‑style question (and answer key) about today’s concept.”  
- Research in active learning shows that creating assessment items itself promotes deeper understanding.[8]
- Quickly review and use the best items in low‑stakes quizzes.

## 3. Participation rubric tailored to a tiny seminar

Make “discussion performance” explicit so it’s fair and focused.[2]

Possible rubric dimensions (each 0–3):
- Uses course concepts accurately in speech.  
- Cites evidence (readings/activities) when making claims.  
- Asks clarifying or probing questions.  
- Connects peers’ comments or synthesizes (“building moves”).  

With 4 students, you can jot quick notes during discussion or immediately after class, then give brief individual feedback midway through the term.

***

## 4. Two summative components

Use a mix of individual and small‑group performance aligned with the outcomes.[9][10]

**a. Short analytical write‑ups (2–3 per term)**  
Examples:
- Demo report: “Explain the swinging‑room activity in terms of information weighting and perception–action coupling.”  
- Scenario analysis: “Given this driving/VR/sport scenario, specify the information a learner must pick up and how practice should be designed.”  

Assess on:
- Conceptual accuracy.  
- Depth of explanation / use of theory.  
- Quality of examples or applications.

**b. Mini project or oral exam at end**

Option 1 – Mini research proposal (written + brief presentation):  
- Students propose a small perception–action study (question, design, predicted pattern, theoretical rationale).  
- Rubric: clarity of question, alignment of design with theory, identification of information variables, feasibility.

Option 2 – Oral exam / structured conversation:  
- 20–25 minutes per student; give 3–4 broad questions in advance.  
- In the session, ask follow‑ups that require application and comparison (e.g., “How would an ecological and a computational theorist interpret this result differently?”).  
- Use a checklist rubric keyed to your outcomes.

***

## 5. Check engagement and adjust

Because active learning can *feel* harder even when it improves performance, periodically ask about their experience.[11][12]

- Use a 3–5 item anonymous survey mid‑semester on:  
  - How challenged they feel.  
  - Which activities help them learn.  
  - Whether expectations for participation and assessment feel clear.  
- Use responses to tweak activity/assessment balance, not to abandon active methods.[12][11]

If you’d like, the next step can be drafting a one‑page “assessment plan” for your syllabus that spells out exactly which artifacts (maps, write‑ups, project) map onto each outcome.
