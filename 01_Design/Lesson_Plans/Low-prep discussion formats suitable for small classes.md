Use formats that turn “talk about the reading” into something concrete and structured, but require almost no prep beyond a prompt.[1][2]

***

## Think–Write–Pair–Share (scaled to 4 students)

- **How it works:**  
  - Pose one focused question about the reading or a demo.  
  - Students think and jot notes for 1–2 minutes, then discuss in pairs for 3–5 minutes before coming back as a group of 4.[2]
- **Why it’s low‑prep:** You only need one good question; the structure does the rest.  
- **Best for:** Clarifying core concepts and lowering the bar for quieter students.

## Round‑Robin with “One Big Idea”

- **How it works:**  
  - Prompt: “Share one idea, quote, or example from the reading that you found striking or puzzling.”  
  - Go around the circle; each student gets 30–60 seconds, no interruptions.  
  - After the first round, open free discussion, asking them to connect or contrast their points.[3][4]
- **Why it’s low‑prep:** No materials; you’re just collecting one contribution per person, then riffing on patterns.  
- **Best for:** Starting a seminar or transitioning from mini‑lecture to discussion.

***

## Minute Thesis

- **How it works:**  
  - Write 3–4 course concepts on the board (e.g., optic flow, affordances, prediction error).  
  - Ask each student to draw a line between any two and, in 1–2 minutes, write a “mini thesis” that links them (“In visually guided locomotion, optic flow specifies affordances for…,” etc.).[5]
  - Everyone reads theirs aloud; then discuss similarities and differences.  
- **Why it’s low‑prep:** You only choose the terms; students generate the connections.  
- **Best for:** Pushing beyond recall into synthesis with minimal setup.

***

## Small Group–Teacher Talk

- **How it works (perfect for N=4):**  
  - Sit with all four as if it were a lab meeting; tell them this segment is an informal “research group chat.”[6]
  - Use 2–3 open questions and let the conversation run, occasionally redirecting or asking someone who hasn’t spoken to weigh in.  
- **Why it’s low‑prep:** It’s basically guided office‑hours; the only prep is your questions.  
- **Best for:** Working through a tricky derivation, model comparison, or paper critique.

***

## Affinity Mapping on the Board

- **How it works:**  
  - Ask a broad question (“What factors shape perception–action coupling in everyday tasks?”).  
  - Students each write several short answers on the board or sticky notes.  
  - As a group of 4, they cluster related ideas into categories (e.g., information, organism constraints, environment, task) and label them.[1]
  - Discuss what ended up where and what’s missing.  
- **Why it’s low‑prep:** You only need a broad prompt and a board.  
- **Best for:** Generating examples, preparing for a paper, or reviewing before an exam.

These five structures can cover most of a small undergraduate seminar; rotate them across a 90‑minute block (e.g., round‑robin to start, think–write–pair–share after a mini‑lecture, minute thesis later, affinity mapping to consolidate) without additional prep beyond your core content.[2][3][5][1]
