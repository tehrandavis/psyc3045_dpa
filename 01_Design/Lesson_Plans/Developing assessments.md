Use multiple quick, low‑stakes checks across the 90 minutes so students are constantly retrieving, applying, and reflecting, without feeling “tested.”[1][2]

## Minute papers and variants

- **Classic one‑minute paper:** At mid‑class or end, ask two prompts on today’s perception–action topic, e.g., “Most important idea?” and “Biggest remaining question?”[3]
  - Collect on paper or digitally, scan for misconceptions, and lightly score (complete/incomplete) or with a simple 0–2 rubric.  
- **3–2–1 prompts:** “3 things you learned, 2 connections to real tasks (e.g., driving, sports), 1 question you still have.”[4]
  - Great at the end of a 90‑minute session to consolidate and feed into next class.

## Quick concept checks during activities

- **Low‑stakes quizzes (5 minutes):** 3–5 short items at the start or after a demo (e.g., “Which variable changes in optic flow as you approach an object?”).[5][6]
  - Make them ungraded or tiny weight; immediately review as a group so the quiz is primarily feedback, not evaluation.  
- **Show‑of‑hands / mini‑whiteboard questions:** Pose a conceptual multiple‑choice question (about tau, affordances, etc.), have each student show an answer simultaneously.[2][5]
  - Brief pair talk if answers differ, then re‑vote (“two‑stage” polling).

## Discussion‑based CATs (Classroom Assessment Techniques)

- **RSQC2 (Recall–Summarize–Question–Connect–Comment):** At ~60–70 minutes, give 5 minutes to: recall key points, summarize in 1–2 sentences, pose a question, connect to prior class, comment on what was surprising.[7]
  - Use to gauge conceptual integration and adjust pacing.  
- **Classroom opinion poll:** Ask for their agreement (0–10 scale) with a claim like “Perception can be fully understood as a computational process on internal representations.”[8]
  - Briefly discuss reasons; this surfaces their theoretical lean while also assessing understanding.

## Simple products tied to activities

- **Prediction–Observation–Explanation slips:** For each demo, have them jot prediction, observation, and explanation on a half‑sheet.[2]
  - Collect and skim; you see who can name information variables and link to theory without grading heavily.  
- **Micro design notes:** After a hands‑on task (e.g., affordance or TTC activity), ask for a 3–4 sentence “design note” describing one way they’d improve the setup and what pattern they’d expect.[9]
  - Assesses experimental reasoning in a tiny, low‑stakes format.

## Reflective checks on process, not just content

- **Process analysis:** Occasionally ask them to outline how they figured something out in class (e.g., “Steps you used to analyze the information available in today’s scenario”).[8]
  - This reveals their strategies and metacognition.  
- **Quick self‑rating:** End of seminar: “Rate your understanding of today’s main concept from 1–5 and write one thing that would move you up a level.”[1][2]
  - Use responses to plan a brief revisit or a targeted starter in the next session.

All of these can be graded for completion or with a simple, transparent rubric, keeping stakes low while giving you rich evidence of learning throughout the 90‑minute seminar.[3][1][2]
