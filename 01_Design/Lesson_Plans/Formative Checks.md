Use a repeating set of very short checks so they become routine and non‑threatening. Here are options you can cycle through every ~15 minutes in a 90‑minute seminar.[1][2][3]

***

## 1. Finger count or quick poll (30–60 seconds)

- Ask: “On a 1–5 scale, how confident are you about [concept just covered]?”  
- Have them show fingers simultaneously (or jot a number on scrap/poll).  
- If you see 1–2s, pause and ask: “What’s fuzzy?” for a 1–2 minute clarification.

***

## 2. One‑sentence summary (2 minutes)

- Prompt: “In one sentence, explain X to a friend who missed class.”  
- Everyone writes; then either:  
  - Quick round‑robin of sentences, or  
  - You skim 4 sentences while they take a short breather.  
- Reveals misunderstandings fast.[2][1]

***

## 3. Prediction check (2–3 minutes)

- Before a demo/example:  
  - “Write a one‑line prediction: What will happen and why?”  
- After you show it, ask:  
  - “Who wants to share a prediction that matched/missed what we saw?”  
- Great for perception–action demos (optic flow, affordances, TTC).[4][5]

***

## 4. Micro “3–2–1” variant (3 minutes)

Use a stripped‑down version mid‑class:[3][6]

- “Write: 2 key terms we just used and 1 thing you’re not sure about.”  
- Scan for the “not sure” items and address 1–2 immediately.

***

## 5. Pass‑the‑question (3–4 minutes)

- Each student writes one question about the last segment.  
- Pass clockwise; each person adds a brief attempted answer or clarification.  
- Take one composite question to address aloud.  
- Checks both their questioning and their ability to respond informally.[7][8]

***

## 6. Concept check “this or that” (1–2 minutes)

- Pose a binary choice that forces commitment:  
  - “In that example, was the *critical* information more about (A) optic flow or (B) efference copy?”  
- Quick show of hands; ask one person from each side to justify in a sentence.  
- Reveals where their mental models differ.[2]

***

## 7. Mini concept map fragment (3–4 minutes)

- Prompt: “Draw a tiny concept map linking today’s new term to at least two prior ideas.”  
- With four students, glance at each and comment: “These two links are key; notice X and Y’s different structures.”  
- Good near the 60‑minute mark to check integration.[1]

***

## 8. Exit‑slip slices (last 15 minutes)

At 75 minutes, do a quick check that also seeds next class:[3][2]

- “Write one thing that changed how you think about perception–action today.”  
- “Write one example from your life that illustrates today’s main concept.”  
- Use a couple of responses to launch the final discussion or to open the next session.

You can plan a rotation (e.g., 0:15 prediction; 0:30 finger count; 0:45 one‑sentence summary; 1:00 this‑or‑that; 1:15 exit slip), so checks stay fresh but predictable for the students.[1][2]
