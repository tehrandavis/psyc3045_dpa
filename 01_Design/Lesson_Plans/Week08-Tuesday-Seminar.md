# Facilitator Script: Week 8 - Coordination Dynamics

**Topic:** The HKB Model & Bernstein's Problem (Blau & Wagman Ch 16 + Bernstein)
**Goal:** Connect the specific (Finger Wiggling) to the general (Degrees of Freedom). Solve the **"Bernstein Problem"** using **Synergies**.

## 🕒 Activity 1: Warm-up - "The HKB Debrief" (00:00 - 00:15)

**Setup:** Refer to last Thursday's **"Finger Wiggling"** Lab.

**🗣️ The Hook:**
> "On Thursday, your fingers betrayed you. You tried to stay in Anti-Phase, but physics forced you into In-Phase.
>
> **The Pivot:** This is proof that your brain is not a 'Commander'. It's a **Tuner**.
> It tunes the landscape, but the landscape dictates the behavior."

## 🕒 Activity 2: Deep Dive - "The Degrees of Freedom Problem" (00:15 - 00:35)

**🗣️ The Set-Up:**
> "Nikolai Bernstein (1967) asked: How do we control our bodies?
> Human arm: 7 joints, 26 muscles, millions of motor units.
> To scratch your nose, you have to coordinate *all* of them.
>
> If the brain had to control each one individually... it would freeze."

**✍️ The Prompt (The Equation):**
> "Degrees of Freedom ($DF$) > Constraints ($C$).
> We have too many options. This is the **Degrees of Freedom Problem**.
>
> **Question:** How do we solve it? How do we reduce the variables?"

## 🕒 Activity 3: Core Activity - "Synergies" (00:35 - 01:00)

**Setup:** Demonstrate "Freezing" vs "Releasing".

**Step 1: The Novice (Freezing)**
> "When you learn to ski/skate, you go stiff. Why?
> You are rigidly coupling your joints to reduce DF.
> You turn 100 muscles into 1 block."

**Step 2: The Expert (Synergy)**
> "When you get better, you release. But you don't release into chaos.
> You form **Synergies** (Coordinative Structures).
>
> **Example:** If I nudge your elbow while you are writing, your wrist *automatically* compensates to keep the pen straight. The wrist and elbow are linked."

**Step 3: The HKB Connection**
> "The HKB Model (fingers) is the simplest Synergy.
> It shows how two parts become one functional unit."

## 🕒 Activity 4: Forward Link - "The Dossier" (01:00 - 01:20)

**🗣️ The Check-in:**
> "We have finished Part I (Perception) and Part II (Action/Dynamics).
> We have dismantled the Computer and built the Dynamical System.
>
> On Thursday, we stop. We breathe.
> We are going to review your **Lab Dossiers**.
> Bring your Field Notes, your Stair Graphs, your Finger Data.
> We are going to turn your pile of papers into a portfolio."

## 🕒 Activity 5: Closing (01:20 - 01:30)

**Minute Paper:**
> "What is a **'Synergy'**? Explain it using the example of a steering wheel (your two hands act as one unit)."
