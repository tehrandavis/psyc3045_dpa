Here are several 10‑minute discussion activities you can drop into a seminar with almost no prep. Each scales well to 4–10 students.

***

## 1. One‑Sentence Round (Concept Capture)

- **Goal:** Check understanding and force concise articulation.  
- **Steps (10 minutes):**  
  - Give a prompt: “In one sentence, explain X to an intelligent non‑specialist.”  
  - 2 minutes: everyone writes their sentence.  
  - 6 minutes: go round the circle, each reads theirs; after each one, allow one brief clarifying question or positive “building” comment from peers.  
  - 2 minutes: ask, “What did we hear in common? What was missing?”  
- **Why it works:** Low risk (they can read), everyone speaks once, and you quickly see misconceptions.

## 2. 3–2–1 Lightning Share

- **Goal:** Consolidate a chunk of class and surface questions.  
- **Prompt:** “Write 3 key ideas, 2 connections to real life, 1 question you still have.”  
- **Steps (10 minutes):**  
  - 4 minutes individual writing.  
  - 4 minutes: each student shares *either* their 2 connections or their 1 question (your choice).  
  - 2 minutes: you pick 1–2 questions to answer or to park for next class.  
- **Why it works:** Produces quick retrieval, transfer, and a built‑in Q&A source.

## 3. Mini “Thesis Pair” and Report‑Out

- **Goal:** Push them from recall to synthesis.  
- **Prompt:** Put 3–4 key terms on the board and say: “In pairs, write a single sentence that links at least two of these in a claim.”  
- **Steps (10 minutes):**  
  - 3 minutes: pairs draft one “thesis sentence.”  
  - 5 minutes: each pair reads theirs; brief reactions (“What evidence would support that?” “How could we test it?”).  
  - 2 minutes: you highlight one especially useful connection.  
- **Why it works:** Forces them to relate concepts instead of listing them.

## 4. Two Corners (or Two Columns) Debate

- **Goal:** Make conceptual contrasts vivid in a short burst.  
- **Setup:** Choose a binary tension: “More consistent with ecological vs. computational accounts,” “Primarily perception vs. action driven,” etc.  
- **Steps (10 minutes):**  
  - 2 minutes: individually decide which side you lean toward and jot one reason.  
  - 4 minutes: students who chose the same side briefly compare reasons.  
  - 4 minutes: whole‑group discussion; one person from each side states their best argument; you ask for one counter‑argument from the other side.  
- **Why it works:** Quick, energizing, and gives structure to disagreement without needing prep materials.

## 5. Pass‑a‑Question Chain

- **Goal:** Practice question‑asking and peer explanation.  
- **Steps (10 minutes):**  
  - 2 minutes: each student writes one honest question about what’s unclear or interesting.  
  - Pass questions clockwise.  
  - 4 minutes: each student writes a brief attempted answer or comment on the question they received.  
  - 4 minutes: choose 1–2 question–answer pairs to read and discuss as a group.  
- **Why it works:** Validates confusion, trains them to articulate answers, and gives you immediate diagnostic information.

## 6. Micro Case + Three Moves

- **Goal:** Apply theory quickly to a concrete situation.  
- **Steps (10 minutes):**  
  - Present a very short case: “A novice driver consistently brakes too late when merging.”  
  - 3 minutes: individually list three “moves” based on course concepts (e.g., change information, constraints, or practice schedule).  
  - 5 minutes: go round and share one move each, no repeats if possible.  
  - 2 minutes: you connect the moves to named theories or models.  
- **Why it works:** Makes application habitual and shows the variety of possible interventions.

***

## 7. Hot Seat Summary

- **Goal:** Encourage active listening and synthesis.  
- **Steps (10 minutes):**  
  - Choose one student as the “summarizer” for this segment; everyone knows it in advance.  
  - After 8 minutes of normal discussion, pause and ask them to summarize the main points in 60–90 seconds.  
  - 2–3 minutes: others can add “one thing you’d add or correct.”  
- **Why it works:** Builds summarizing skill and keeps everyone listening for the big ideas.

***

## 8. Text-Anchor Discussion

- **Goal:** Keep talk grounded in readings.  
- **Steps (10 minutes):**  
  - Ask: “Pick one sentence or figure from the reading that you think is central.”  
  - 3 minutes: students find and mark their choice.  
  - 5 minutes: each reads theirs and explains why they chose it.  
  - 2 minutes: you connect the anchors into a mini narrative of the reading.  
- **Why it works:** Moves them away from vague recollections to evidence‑based discussion.

You can script a 90‑minute seminar as 4–5 content segments, each followed by one of these 10‑minute activities, so students expect that “we talk *and* we do a quick structured thing” every time.
