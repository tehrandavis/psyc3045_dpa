Here are concrete, perception–action–specific active learning activities that work well with exactly four students. Each is designed for a 50–75 minute seminar and assumes you want them physically and cognitively engaged, not just talking abstractly.[1][2]

***

## 1. Predict–Observe–Explain (POE) with Perceptual Phenomena

Use POE cycles to surface their assumptions, confront them with data, and then tie back to theory.[2][3]

**Setup examples (pick one per class):**
- Optic flow and vection videos
- Tau/time‑to‑contact clips (e.g., different approach speeds)
- Postural sway with vision vs. no vision (simple doorway sway demo)

**Flow (for ~20–25 min):**
1. **Predict (5 min).**  
   - Pose a concrete question: “If we remove visual information but keep vestibular cues, what happens to postural stability in quiet standing?”  
   - Each student writes an individual prediction with a brief rationale (no discussion yet).

2. **Observe (5–10 min).**  
   - Run a quick demo or show short video; everyone watches and jots down what actually happens.  
   - Ask them to note *exactly* what information is available in each condition (visual, vestibular, proprioceptive).

3. **Explain (10–15 min).**  
   - Go around: each student briefly compares prediction vs. outcome.  
   - Then whole‑group discussion:  
     - Which theoretical account (e.g., cue integration, ecological specification) best explains the pattern?  
     - What does this imply about how the perceptual system exploits available information?

**Why it works:** Combines concrete experience with theory, forces commitment to a prediction, then supports conceptual change when predictions fail.[3][2]

## 2. Micro Jigsaw: Two Theories, Four Students

Take advantage of the small N by treating them as “expert pairs.”[4][1]

**Example topic:** Ecological vs. computational accounts of perception.

**Flow (~30 min):**
1. **Expert prep in pairs (10–12 min).**  
   - Pair 1: Ecological perspective (Gibsonian information, affordances).  
   - Pair 2: Computational perspective (representations, inverse problems).  
   - Give each pair a short excerpt or figure plus 2 guiding questions.

2. **Teach‑back (10–12 min).**  
   - Reconvene as a group of 4.  
   - Pair 1 has 5–6 minutes to “teach” their view, while Pair 2 notes:  
     - One strength  
     - One question or critique.  
   - Swap roles.

3. **Synthesis mini‑debate (8–10 min).**  
   - Prompt: “Designing a visually guided locomotion system, which approach offers better actionable guidance and why?”  
   - Let them argue, but require that every point be tied to something from the prep texts or demo you’ve shown.

**Optional extension:** Each student writes a 3–4 sentence “position statement” at the end, which you skim to tune the next class.

## 3. Perception–Action Design Studio (“Psychbusters” Lite)

Adapt the “Psychbusters” / product‑evaluation assignment to a short in‑class format.[5][2]

**Example:** Evaluate a commercial product or claim: blue‑light glasses, “brain‑training” games, VR balance trainers, sports vision training.

**Flow (~30–35 min):**
1. **Problem brief (5 min).**  
   - Present one concrete claim (print ad, short video, or website excerpt).  
   - The question: “Does the claim align with what we know about sensory information and action control? If not, what’s wrong with the story?”

2. **Paired analysis (10–12 min).**  
   - Two pairs, each with a slightly different lens, for instance:  
     - Pair A: Information & constraints – what information variables could actually be affected?  
     - Pair B: Mechanisms & learning – what neural/behavioral mechanisms would have to change?

3. **Group verdict (12–15 min).**  
   - Each pair presents their analysis (3–4 minutes).  
   - Then all four must co‑write a brief “verdict statement” on the board (or shared doc) summarizing:  
     - Supported claims  
     - Questionable claims  
     - One testable prediction to evaluate the product scientifically.

**Why it works:** Authentic application, critical thinking about information, and neat bridge to research design.[2]

***

## 4. Concept Mapping the Perception–Action Loop

Have them externalize their mental models and then critique them.[6][7]

**Flow (~20–25 min):**
1. **Individual concept maps (8–10 min).**  
   - Prompt: “Draw a concept map showing how perception, action, environment, and organismal constraints are related, using as many specific constructs from the course as possible (e.g., affordances, optic flow, efference copy).”  
   - They work silently on paper or tablet.

2. **Pair comparison (5–7 min).**  
   - Students pair up, compare maps, and identify:  
     - One connection they share  
     - One connection that differs or that they find surprising.

3. **Whole‑group gallery & critique (7–10 min).**  
   - Lay maps out or project photos.  
   - Discuss:  
     - Which maps emphasize information, which emphasize motor commands?  
     - Where might each map mislead a novice?

**Extension:** Over the semester, repeat the exercise and have them compare early vs. later maps to make conceptual growth visible.

## 5. Live Mini‑Experiment: Affordance Judgment

Use the 4‑person group as a micro research team running a quick affordance experiment.

**Example:** Stair or step “climbability,” or doorway “passability.”

**Flow (~35–40 min):**
1. **Research question & design (10–12 min).**  
   - Together, articulate: “How well can people judge whether they can step up onto a surface without using their hands?”  
   - Assign roles: experimenter, participant 1, observer/data recorder, method critic (roles rotate midway).[4]
   - As a group, quickly decide:  
     - What physical set‑up you can use (step, box, stack of books).  
     - How to vary step height.  
     - What will count as “yes, I can” vs. “no, I can’t” judgments.

2. **Data collection (10–15 min).**  
   - Run a small series of trials with two participants while the others record step height and response.  
   - Swap roles so everyone participates at least once.

3. **Analysis & theory link (10–15 min).**  
   - Plot or at least eyeball judgment vs. actual ability (e.g., when they actually fail).  
   - Discuss:  
     - How do results relate to affordances defined in body‑scaled units rather than absolute units?  
     - What information might they have used (visual angle, effort sense)?  
     - How would you improve this study if you had a motion capture lab?

**Why it works:** Embeds perception–action content in a mini research design exercise, with everyone doing, not just watching.[2]

***

## 6. Structured “Panel” Discussion on a Scenario

Turn the four students into a multidisciplinary design panel.[6][4]

**Example scenario:** “Designing a VR training system to improve braking behavior in novice drivers.”

**Flow (~25–30 min):**
1. **Assign perspectives (3–5 min).**  
   - Student 1: Ecological psychologist (information/affordances).  
   - Student 2: Cognitive psychologist (representations, expectations).  
   - Student 3: Neuroscientist (sensorimotor pathways, plasticity).  
   - Student 4: Human factors / applied scientist (constraints, safety, usability).

2. **Prep (7–10 min).**  
   - Each writes:  
     - 2 priorities from their perspective.  
     - 1 constraint or risk.

3. **Panel (12–15 min).**  
   - You act as moderator: ask each for an opening statement, then a couple of targeted questions.  
   - Require them to explicitly reference course concepts (e.g., optic flow, time‑to‑collision, signal detection).

4. **Debrief (5 min).**  
   - As a group, identify where perspectives align and conflict.  
   - Ask: “If you had to pick one change to implement tomorrow, what would it be?”

***

## 7. Repeated Minute Papers as Discussion Seeds

Embed quick write–discuss cycles to keep talk grounded and inclusive.[7][1]

**Template you can reuse any day (~10–15 min):**
1. **Minute paper (3 min).**  
   - Prompt examples:  
     - “What’s one thing that still feels mysterious about how perception guides action?”  
     - “What’s one connection between today’s reading and something you’ve experienced in sports, driving, or gaming?”

2. **Pair share (5 min).**  
   - Each pair picks one idea they want the full group to discuss.

3. **Whole‑group share (5–7 min).**  
   - Each pair shares; you use their ideas to launch a brief discussion or to decide what to revisit next time.

**Why it works:** Lowers bar to participation, gives you rapid formative assessment, and scales perfectly to four students.

***

If you’d like, a full 75‑minute sample lesson plan can be drafted that chains two or three of these (e.g., POE demo → micro‑experiment design → short panel), tuned to a specific topic like time‑to‑contact or visual control of locomotion.
