# Facilitator Script: Week 6 - Dynamic Touch & Haptics

**Topic:** The Inertia Tensor (Blau & Wagman Ch 8 + Turvey)
**Goal:** Formalize the mechanics of touch. Introduce the concept of **"Smart Perceptual Instruments."**

## 🕒 Activity 1: Warm-up - "The Illusion Debrief" (00:00 - 00:15)

**Setup:** Refer to last Thursday's **"Wielding Game"**.

**🗣️ The Hook:**
> "On Thursday, we fooled your hands. We moved a weight to the tip of a rod, and you swore the rod grew longer.
>
> **Question:** Was your perception 'wrong'?
>
> If you were trying to perceive *Length* (Geometric)... yes, you were wrong.
> But what if you were perceiving *Wield-ability* (Dynamic)?
>
> **The Pivot:** A rod with a heavy tip *behaves* like a long rod. Your muscles were right. Your geometry was wrong."

## 🕒 Activity 2: Deep Dive - "The Inertia Tensor" (00:15 - 00:35)

**🗣️ The Set-Up:**
> "Turn to Turvey. He talks about the **Inertia Tensor**.
> This sounds scary. It isn't. It's just a 3x3 matrix that tells you how an object resists rotation."

**✍️ The Prompt (Whiteboard):**
> "Draw a rod.
> If I push it (Translation), I feel Mass ($F=ma$).
> If I spin it (Rotation), I feel Inertia ($T=I\alpha$).
>
> **The Key Concept:** We almost never just 'translate' objects. We wield them. We rotate them around joints (wrist, elbow). Therefore, the **Moment of Inertia** is the primary information."

## 🕒 Activity 3: Core Activity - "Smart Perceptual Instruments" (00:35 - 01:00)

**Setup:** We need to broaden "Touch" beyond the skin.

**Step 1: The Probe**
> "Pick up your pen. Close your eyes. Rub the table.
> Do you feel the pressure on your fingers? Or do you feel the *texture of the table*?
> (Table).
>
> This is Runeson's **'Smart Polar Planimeter'** principle. The instrument (the hand) is designed to ignore the medium (pressure) and detect the target (surface)."

**Step 2: The Soft Assembly**
> "When you hold the pen, it becomes part of you. The 'Haptic System' isn't the hand. It's the **Hand + Pen System**.
> The boundary of the body is fluid."

## 🕒 Activity 4: Forward Link - "Dynamics" (01:00 - 01:20)

**🗣️ The Tease:**
> "We've spent 6 weeks talking about 'Perceiving' things (Stairs, Rods).
> But wielding requires **Movement**.
>
> To feel the rod, you have to shake it. To see the stair, you have to walk.
>
> Perception is dynamic. But movement itself has rules.
> Why do you walk the way you do? Why is it hard to rub your tummy and pat your head?"

**The Bridge:**
> "On Thursday, we stop looking at 'Objects'. We start looking at **Behavior**.
> We are going to map your **Attractors**."

## 🕒 Activity 5: Closing (01:20 - 01:30)

**Minute Paper:**
> "Explain why a blind person's cane is not an 'object' they perceive, but an 'organ' they perceive *with*."
