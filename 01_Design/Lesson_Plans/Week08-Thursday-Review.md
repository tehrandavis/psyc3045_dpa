## Session Overview

### Pedagogical Goal
Students will consolidate their "Messy Data" from Weeks 1-7 into a coherent **Lab Dossier**. This is the mid-semester checkpoint. They must organize their evidence to tell the story of the course: "How we rejected the Computer and found the Ecosystem."

### Key Insight
"Science isn't just collecting data. It's curating evidence."

---

**Materials Needed**

**Activity:**
- [ ] Students bring all Lab Worksheets, Field Notes, and Graphs (Weeks 1-7).
- [ ] Folders/Binders (if physical).
- [ ] Staplers, Tape, Highlighters.
- [ ] The "Dossier Checklist" (Rubric).

## Detailed Timeline

### 0:00-0:10 | The Goal
**Routine:** Standard Opening (Skipped today).
**Prompt:** "Today is a working session. By the end of this class, your random worksheets will become a **Scientific Dossier**."

### 0:10-0:40 | Part 1: The Audit (Peer Review)
**Goal:** Identifying Gaps.

**Protocol:**
1.  **Pair Up:** Exchange piles.
2.  **The Checklist:** Check for:
    *   Week 1: Logic Trap Worksheet.
    *   Week 2: Action vs. Perception Graphs.
    *   Week 3: Tau/Looming Sketches.
    *   Week 4: Stair Lab ($\pi$ Calculation).
    *   Week 5: Wielding Game (Inertia Diagram).
    *   Week 6: Attractor Map.
    *   Week 7: HKB Bifurcation Diagram.
3.  **Feedback:** "You are missing the HKB graph. You need to redraw the Stair ratio."

### 0:40-0:60 | Part 2: The Narrative (The Executive Summary)
**Goal:** Synthesis.

**Task:**
"Write a 1-page **Executive Summary** for your Dossier.
Answer this question: **'Based on this evidence, why did we reject the Computer Metaphor?'**
Reference at least 3 of your labs as proof."

*   *Example:* "We rejected the 'Poverty of Stimulus' because the Stair Lab proved information is body-scaled ($0.88$ ratio), not ambiguous."

### 0:60-0:75 | Part 3: The Check-in (Instructor Review)
**Goal:** Grading/Feedback.

**Action:**
*   Instructor circulates.
*   "Show me your best graph."
*   "Show me your Field Notes."
*   **Sign-off:** Give them a 'Provisional Pass' or 'Revise' status.

**Assignment:**
*   **DUE:** Final Polish of Lab Dossier (if not finished today).
*   **DUE:** Thought Paper 2 (Friday).
*   **Enjoy Spring Break!** (Next week: Social Coordination).

## Post-Session Notes
*   Who is struggling to organize their data?
*   Are the narratives connecting the labs to the theory?
