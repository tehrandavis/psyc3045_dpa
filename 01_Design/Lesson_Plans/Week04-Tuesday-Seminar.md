# Facilitator Script: Week 4 - Ecological Optics

**Topic:** The Ambient Optic Array (Blau & Wagman Ch 6)
**Goal:** Define the **"Stuff"** of perception. Move from "Light as Rays" to "Light as Structure."

## 🕒 Activity 1: Warm-up - "The Tau Debrief" (00:00 - 00:15)

**Setup:** Refer to last Thursday's **"Visualizing Tau"** Lab.

**🗣️ The Hook:**
> "Last Thursday, we watched the balloon explode. We saw the Gannets dive.
> We proved that you don't need distance. You need **Expansion**.
>
> But here is the hard question: **What exactly is expanding?**
>
> Is it the object? No.
> Is it the 'image on the retina'? (Ch 6 says NO).
> So... what is it?"

**👂 Listen For:**
*   "The solid angle?"
*   "The texture?"
*   "The structure in the light?"

**🗣️ The Transition:**
> "Exactly. It's the **Structure**. This week, we define the medium. We define the **Ambient Optic Array**."

## 🕒 Activity 2: Deep Dive - "The Room with a View" (00:15 - 00:35)

**🗣️ The Set-Up:**
> "Turn to Chapter 6. They make a huge distinction between **Radiant Light** and **Ambient Light**.
> Why? Why can't we just study photons?"

**✍️ The Prompt (Whiteboard Diagram):**
> "Draw a lightbulb. Draw an eye.
> **Question:** Does the lightbulb have information? (No, it's uniform).
> **Question:** When does the light get 'smart'? (When it hits a surface).
>
> **The Key Concept:** Light becomes information only when it is structured by the environment."

**🗣️ The Demo (The Occlusion Edge):**
*   Hold a book in front of your face.
*   "I can't see the door. The book is occluding it."
*   Move the book slightly.
*   "Now I see it. The **deletion** and **accretion** of texture at the edge tells me which object is in front."
*   "This isn't math. This is geometry."

## 🕒 Activity 3: Core Activity - "Mapping the Array" (00:35 - 01:00)

**Setup:** Students stand in different parts of the room.

**Step 1: The Unique Point of Observation**
> "Everyone freeze. Look at your view.
> Is anyone else seeing *exactly* what you are seeing?
> No. Your view is unique to your point in space-time."

**Step 2: The Flow Field**
> "Now walk forward. What happens to the texture on the floor?"
> *(It flows out).*
> "What happens to the texture at the horizon?"
> *(It stays still).*
>
> "This is **Global Optical Flow**. It specifies YOUR movement, not the world's movement."

**Step 3: The Array vs. The Image**
> "Why does Gibson hate the word 'Image'?
> Because an image is static. The Array is dynamic. It exists even if you aren't looking at it."

## 🕒 Activity 4: Forward Link - "Body Scaling" (01:00 - 01:20)

**🗣️ The Tease:**
> "Okay, so the light has structure. It tells us about surfaces (walls, floors).
> But does it tell us what we can **DO**?
>
> Does the light say 'This is a wall'? Or does it say 'This is an obstacle'?"

**The Thought Experiment:**
> "Imagine a giant staircase. Steps are 4 feet high.
> To me, that's a wall.
> To a giant, that's a staircase.
>
> The physics is the same. The affordance is different. Why?"

**🗣️ The Assignment:**
> "On Thursday, we are going on a field trip. We are going to find the **Great Staircase**.
> And we are going to measure your legs. Because perception is **Body-Scaled**."

## 🕒 Activity 5: Closing (01:20 - 01:30)

**Minute Paper:**
> "Define **'Ambient Optic Array'** without using the word 'Picture' or 'Image'."
