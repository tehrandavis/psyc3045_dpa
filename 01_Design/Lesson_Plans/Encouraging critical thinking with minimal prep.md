Here are flexible prompts you can reuse across topics that reliably push students past recall into **critical** thinking, with essentially no prep.

## Evidence and assumptions

Use these right after a claim, definition, or example:

- “What evidence **supports** this claim, and what evidence might challenge it?”  
- “What **assumptions** does this idea rely on? Are any of them questionable?”  
- “If this claim were **false**, what would we expect to see instead?”  
- “How could we **test** or verify this in a simple study or real‑world context?”  

## Comparing ideas and perspectives

Use when you have two theories, models, or examples on the table:

- “In what **important way** are these two ideas similar, and in what important way are they different?”  
- “What would a critic from [Other School/Perspective] say about this view?”  
- “Where does each approach **work best**, and where does it start to break down?”  
- “If you had to **combine** these perspectives, what might a hybrid explanation look like?”

## Consequences, limits, and “so what”

Use when students seem to “get” a concept but haven’t pushed it:

- “If this is true, what are the **practical consequences** for how we study or intervene?”  
- “Who or what might be **left out** if we think about the problem only this way?”  
- “What is one **context** where this idea probably fails or needs revision?”  
- “Why might this concept **matter** to someone outside this class?”

## Perspective‑taking and alternatives

Use to surface other viewpoints:

- “How might someone with very different **background or goals** see this issue?”  
- “What is a **respectable opposing view**, and what is its strongest argument?”  
- “If you strongly **disagreed** with this, how would you argue your case?”  
- “What’s one **alternative explanation** for the same finding or phenomenon?”

## Reflection on thinking

Use at transitions or the end of an activity:

- “What part of your **thinking changed** during this discussion, if at all? Why?”  
- “What did you **initially believe**, and what makes you more or less confident now?”  
- “Where are you still **uncertain**, and what kind of evidence would help?”  
- “What’s one question you could ask that would **deepen** this conversation further?”

You can keep a short list of these on a notecard and just plug in the current concept (e.g., optic flow, affordances, representations) to generate high‑yield, critical‑thinking prompts on the fly.
