Here are concrete, perception–action–specific active learning activities that work well with exactly four students. Each is designed for a 50–75 minute seminar and assumes you want them physically and cognitively engaged, not just talking abstractly.[1][2]

***

## 1. Predict–Observe–Explain (POE) with Perceptual Phenomena

Use POE cycles to surface their assumptions, confront them with data, and then tie back to theory.[2][3]

**Setup examples (pick one per class):**
- Optic flow and vection videos
- Tau/time‑to‑contact clips (e.g., different approach speeds)
- Postural sway with vision vs. no vision (simple doorway sway demo)

**Flow (for ~20–25 min):**
1. **Predict (5 min).**  
   - Pose a concrete question: “If we remove visual information but keep vestibular cues, what happens to postural stability in quiet standing?”  
   - Each student writes an individual prediction with a brief rationale (no discussion yet).

2. **Observe (5–10 min).**  
   - Run a quick demo or show short video; everyone watches and jots down what actually happens.  
   - Ask them to note *exactly* what information is available in each condition (visual, vestibular, proprioceptive).

3. **Explain (10–15 min).**  
   - Go around: each student briefly compares prediction vs. outcome.  
   - Then whole‑group discussion:  
     - Which theoretical account (e.g., cue integration, ecological specification) best explains the pattern?  
     - What does this imply about how the perceptual system exploits available information?

**Why it works:** Combines concrete experience with theory, forces commitment to a prediction, then supports conceptual change when predictions fail.[3][2]

## 2. Micro Jigsaw: Two Theories, Four Students

Take advantage of the small N by treating them as “expert pairs.”[4][1]

**Example topic:** Ecological vs. computational accounts of perception.

**Flow (~30 min):**
1. **Expert prep in pairs (10–12 min).**  
   - Pair 1: Ecological perspective (Gibsonian information, affordances).  
   - Pair 2: Computational perspective (representations, inverse problems).  
   - Give each pair a short excerpt or figure plus 2 guiding questions.

2. **Teach‑back (10–12 min).**  
   - Reconvene as a group of 4.  
   - Pair 1 has 5–6 minutes to “teach” their view, while Pair 2 notes:  
     - One strength  
     - One question or critique.  
   - Swap roles.

3. **Synthesis mini‑debate (8–10 min).**  
   - Prompt: “Designing a visually guided locomotion system, which approach offers better actionable guidance and why?”  
   - Let them argue, but require that every point be tied to something from the prep texts or demo you’ve shown.

**Optional extension:** Each student writes a 3–4 sentence “position statement” at the end, which you skim to tune the next class.

***

## 3. Perception–Action Design Studio (“Psychbusters” Lite)

Adapt the “Psychbusters” / product‑evaluation assignment to a short in‑class format.[5][2]

**Example:** Evaluate a commercial product or claim: blue‑light glasses, “brain‑training” games, VR balance trainers, sports vision training.

**Flow (~30–35 min):**
1. **Problem brief (5 min).**  
   - Present one concrete claim (print ad, short video, or website excerpt).  
   - The question: “Does the claim align with what we know about sensory information and action control? If not, what’s wrong with the story?”

2. **Paired analysis (10–12 min).**  
   - Two pairs, each with a slightly different lens, for instance:  
     - Pair A: Information & constraints – what information variables could actually be affected?  
     - Pair B: Mechanisms & learning – what neural/behavioral mechanisms would have to change?

3. **Group verdict (12–15 min).**  
   - Each pair presents their analysis (3–4 minutes).  
   - Then all four must co‑write a brief “verdict statement” on the board (or shared doc) summarizing:  
     - Supported claims  
     - Questionable claims  
     - One testable prediction to evaluate the product scientifically.

**Why it works:** Authentic application, critical thinking about information, and neat bridge to research design.[2]

***

## 4. Concept Mapping the Perception–Action Loop

Have them externalize their mental models and then critique them.[6][7]

**Flow (~20–25 min):**
1. **Individual concept maps (8–10 min).**  
   - Prompt: “Draw a concept map showing how perception, action, environment, and organismal constraints are related, using as many specific constructs from the course as possible (e.g., affordances, optic flow, efference copy).”  
   - They work silently on paper or tablet.

2. **Pair comparison (5–7 min).**  
   - Students pair up, compare maps, and identify:  
     - One connection they share  
     - One connection that differs or that they find surprising.

3. **Whole‑group gallery & critique (7–10 min).**  
   - Lay maps out or project photos.  
   - Discuss:  
     - Which maps emphasize information, which emphasize motor commands?  
     - Where might each map mislead a novice?

**Extension:** Over the semester, repeat the exercise and have them compare early vs. later maps to make conceptual growth visible.

***

## 5. Live Mini‑Experiment: Affordance Judgment

Use the 4‑person group as a micro research team running a quick affordance experiment.

**Example:** Stair or step “climbability,” or doorway “passability.”

**Flow (~35–40 min):**
1. **Research question & design (10–12 min).**  
   - Together, articulate: “How well can people judge whether they can step up onto a surface without using their hands?”  
   - Assign roles: experimenter, participant 1, observer/data recorder, method critic (roles rotate midway).[4]
   - As a group, quickly decide:  
     - What physical set‑up you can use (step, box, stack of books).  
     - How to vary step height.  
     - What will count as “yes, I can” vs. “no, I can’t” judgments.

2. **Data collection (10–15 min).**  
   - Run a small series of trials with two participants while the others record step height and response.  
   - Swap roles so everyone participates at least once.

3. **Analysis & theory link (10–15 min).**  
   - Plot or at least eyeball judgment vs. actual ability (e.g., when they actually fail).  
   - Discuss:  
     - How do results relate to affordances defined in body‑scaled units rather than absolute units?  
     - What information might they have used (visual angle, effort sense)?  
     - How would you improve this study if you had a motion capture lab?

**Why it works:** Embeds perception–action content in a mini research design exercise, with everyone doing, not just watching.[2]

***

## 6. Structured “Panel” Discussion on a Scenario

Turn the four students into a multidisciplinary design panel.[6][4]

**Example scenario:** “Designing a VR training system to improve braking behavior in novice drivers.”

**Flow (~25–30 min):**
1. **Assign perspectives (3–5 min).**  
   - Student 1: Ecological psychologist (information/affordances).  
   - Student 2: Cognitive psychologist (representations, expectations).  
   - Student 3: Neuroscientist (sensorimotor pathways, plasticity).  
   - Student 4: Human factors / applied scientist (constraints, safety, usability).

2. **Prep (7–10 min).**  
   - Each writes:  
     - 2 priorities from their perspective.  
     - 1 constraint or risk.

3. **Panel (12–15 min).**  
   - You act as moderator: ask each for an opening statement, then a couple of targeted questions.  
   - Require them to explicitly reference course concepts (e.g., optic flow, time‑to‑collision, signal detection).

4. **Debrief (5 min).**  
   - As a group, identify where perspectives align and conflict.  
   - Ask: “If you had to pick one change to implement tomorrow, what would it be?”

***

## 7. Repeated Minute Papers as Discussion Seeds

Embed quick write–discuss cycles to keep talk grounded and inclusive.[7][1]

**Template you can reuse any day (~10–15 min):**
1. **Minute paper (3 min).**  
   - Prompt examples:  
     - “What’s one thing that still feels mysterious about how perception guides action?”  
     - “What’s one connection between today’s reading and something you’ve experienced in sports, driving, or gaming?”

2. **Pair share (5 min).**  
   - Each pair picks one idea they want the full group to discuss.

3. **Whole‑group share (5–7 min).**  
   - Each pair shares; you use their ideas to launch a brief discussion or to decide what to revisit next time.

**Why it works:** Lowers bar to participation, gives you rapid formative assessment, and scales perfectly to four students.

## Other ideas
Here are three concrete, low‑prep, perception–action activities with materials and step‑by‑step procedures.[1][2][3]

***

## Activity 1: “Swinging Room” Lite – Vision and Postural Control

Models Lee & Aronson’s swinging‑room finding that visual information can override other balance cues.[2][1]

### Learning goal
Show that small visual changes can destabilize posture even when proprioceptive and vestibular cues are unchanged.

### Materials
- 1–2 large cardboard sheets, foam boards, or lightweight poster boards (to act as “walls”)  
- Painter’s tape or string to mark a standing position on the floor  
- Blindfold (or beanie/hoodie pulled over eyes)  
- Open space near a wall or whiteboard  
- Optional: phone with level app or simple sway scoring sheet

### Procedure
1. **Baseline stance (no manipulation).**  
   - One student stands on the floor mark, feet shoulder‑width apart, looking straight ahead at a static wall/board.  
   - Others watch from the side and note visible sway for 20–30 seconds.

2. **Visual sway condition.**  
   - Two students stand in front of the participant, holding a large board close (but not touching).  
   - Slowly rock the board forward and back ∼2–3 cm, synchronized, for 20–30 seconds.  
   - Observers note changes in the participant’s sway (often they sway with the “moving room”).[1]

3. **Eyes‑closed condition.**  
   - Same stance, but blindfold the participant.  
   - Repeat the subtle wall movement (they can’t see it), observe any change in sway.

4. **Debrief (whole group).**  
   - Compare observed sway across conditions.  
   - Discuss:  
     - Why does visual manipulation affect balance more than expected?  
     - What does this say about weighting of visual vs. nonvisual information in postural control?

***

## Activity 2: Doorway “Passability” – Affordance Judgments

A classic affordance task: judging whether one can pass through an opening without turning shoulders.[4][2]

### Learning goal
Experience how action possibilities (affordances) are scaled to body dimensions, not just absolute physical dimensions.

### Materials
- A doorway or movable desks/whiteboards to create a variable opening  
- Measuring tape or ruler  
- Sticky notes or masking tape to mark widths  
- Simple data sheet (paper or shared doc) for each student

### Procedure
1. **Measure body scale.**  
   - Each student measures their shoulder width (or widest body part relevant to passing through a gap).  
   - Record shoulder width on the data sheet.

2. **Set up openings.**  
   - Use a doorway and tape to mark several widths (e.g., 0.9×, 1.0×, 1.1×, 1.2× each person’s shoulder width), or arrange desks to create adjustable gaps.  
   - Note the absolute width for each setting.

3. **Judgment phase.**  
   - For each width, each student (without trying it yet) stands a set distance away and judges: “Can I pass through normally without turning?” (Yes/No).  
   - Record judgments for all widths.

4. **Action phase.**  
   - Now have each student actually attempt to walk through at each width, first “as judged,” then in borderline cases.  
   - Record actual success/failure.

5. **Analysis & discussion.**  
   - For each student, compute the smallest width they *judged* passable and the smallest width they *actually* managed.  
   - Express each as a ratio of shoulder width (Wgap / Wshoulder).  
   - Discuss:  
     - Are judgments tuned to a consistent body‑scaled ratio?  
     - Do students systematically over‑ or underestimate their capabilities?  
     - How would vision, prior experience, or risk preferences influence this?

## Activity 3: Time‑to‑Contact Intuition – Catching and Interception

Use simple throwing tasks to surface students’ intuitive use of tau/time‑to‑contact information.[5][4][1]

### Learning goal
Explore the information people might use to time interceptive actions (e.g., catching, moving to intercept) and connect it to optic flow / tau.

### Materials
- Soft balls (foam balls, beanbags, or rolled‑up socks)  
- Painter’s tape to mark positions on the floor  
- Stopwatch or phone timer (optional)  
- Whiteboard or paper for sketching trajectories

### Procedure
1. **Constant distance, varying speed.**  
   - Mark two positions on the floor ∼3–4 m apart.  
   - One student stands at the “throw” line, another at the “catch” line.  
   - Thrower makes 6–8 throws at *different speeds* but from the same distance.  
   - Catcher’s task: try to clap hands exactly at the moment the ball would reach them (they may or may not catch it).  
   - Observers note perceived ease/difficulty and any consistent timing errors (too early vs. too late).

2. **Constant speed, varying distance.**  
   - Now have the thrower aim for similar speeds but vary distance (step closer or farther).  
   - Repeat the clap‑at‑arrival task.  
   - Again note patterns in timing.

3. **Angle change condition (optional).**  
   - Have the catcher start off to the side and move laterally to intercept a gently thrown ball; everyone watches path and timing.  
   - Ask: does the catcher adjust speed continuously, or once, etc.?

4. **Group debrief.**  
   - Ask students individually:  
     - “What did you *feel* you were using to time your claps/movements?”  
       - Size change? Speed of looming? Distance? Rhythm?  
   - Sketch a simple optic flow / tau depiction on the board (approach = rate of change in visual angle over current angle).[6][4]
   - Connect subjective reports to theory:  
     - Are they relying on tau‑like information (time‑to‑contact from visual expansion), constant bearing strategies, or something else?  
     - How might this differ for novice vs. skilled athletes?

If you share which specific topics (e.g., optic flow, locomotion, coordination dynamics) you’re tackling in the next few weeks, tailored variants of these three activities can be drafted for each class session.
