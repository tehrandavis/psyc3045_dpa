# Week 5 Thursday: Instructor Guide
## "The Wielding Game" - Dynamic Touch & The Inertia Tensor

**Date:** Thursday, February 12, 2026
**Duration:** 75 minutes
**Class Size:** 5 students
**Mode:** Primer (Data & Experience)

---

## Session Overview

### Pedagogical Goal
Students will discover that "touch" is not just pressure on the skin (cutaneous) but a dynamic exploration of forces (haptic). By wielding rods of different lengths/masses without seeing them, they will prove that **Rotational Inertia** (resistance to turning) specifies spatial properties like length.

### Key Insight
"You don't feel the weight (gravity). You feel the **swing** (inertia)."

**Materials Needed**

**Activity:**
- [ ] A set of dowels/rods (PVC or wood) of different lengths.
- [ ] Weights (washers) to attach to the rods at different positions.
- [ ] A curtain or blindfold (to block vision).
- [ ] A target board (for reaching/pointing).

**Empirical Snapshot:**
- [ ] **Turvey (1996) / Solomon & Turvey (1988)** - The "Sweet Spot" graphs showing Length vs. Moment of Inertia ($I_{xx}$). 
- [ ] The Power Law equation: $L \propto I_{xx}^{1/3}$.

## Detailed Timeline

### 0:00-0:15 | Field Notes (Standard Opening)
**Routine:** Round-robin share
**Prompt:** "Did you notice any 'Body-Scaled' affordances this week? A chair that was 'too low'? A shelf that was 'too high'?"

---

### 0:15-0:45 | Part 1: The Activity (The Mystery)
**Goal:** Generate "Messy Data" on Haptic Perception.

**Protocol: The "Blind" Reach**
1.  **Setup:** Student A is blindfolded. Holds a rod by the handle.
2.  **Task:** "Reach out and touch the target with the tip of the rod."
3.  **Variable:** Change the rod length.
4.  **Observation:** Is their reach accurate? (Usually yes, very).

**Protocol: The "Illusion" (The Inertia Manipulation)**
1.  **Setup:** Take two identical rods.
2.  **Rod A:** Weight at the handle.
3.  **Rod B:** Weight at the tip.
4.  **Task:** "Which one feels longer?"
5.  **Result:** Rod B feels significantly longer. Why? (Physics: Higher Moment of Inertia).

### 0:45-0:65 | Part 2: The Empirical Snapshot (The Evidence)
**Goal:** Validate their experience with "Official Science."

**The Pivot:**
"You thought Rod B was longer. It wasn't. They were the same length. You were fooled by the **Physics of Rotation**."

**The Artifact: Turvey (1996)**
*   **Show the Graph:** Perceived Length vs. Actual Length (perfect line).
*   **Show the "Illusion" Graph:** Perceived Length vs. Moment of Inertia ($I$).
*   **The Math:** "The brain doesn't measure 'pressure'. It measures how hard it is to **turn** the object ($Torque = I \times \alpha$)."
*   **The Invariant:** The **Inertia Tensor** is the haptic equivalent of the Optic Array.

**Discussion:**
*   "Why does a hammer have a heavy head? To increase inertia. To make it 'feel' powerful."

---

### 0:65-0:75 | Part 3: Synthesis & Assignment
**Goal:** File the Dossier & Prime the Reading.

**Lab Worksheet:**
*   Diagram the "Rod B" illusion (Weight at tip = Feels Long).
*   Define "Inertia" in the context of touch.

**Reading Assignment (For Tuesday):**
*   **Read:** Blau & Wagman Ch 8 (Haptics).
*   **Read:** Turvey & Carello (1995) (Dynamic Touch).
*   "Read about the **Inertia Tensor**. It's the math of feeling."

---

## Post-Session Notes
*   Did the weight manipulation work? (Make sure weights are heavy enough to feel).
