# Week 7 Thursday: Instructor Guide
## "The Finger Wiggling Phase Transition" - Bifurcation & HKB

**Date:** Thursday, February 26, 2026
**Duration:** 75 minutes
**Class Size:** 5 students
**Mode:** Primer (Data & Experience)

---

## Session Overview

### Pedagogical Goal
Students will experience a **Non-Equilibrium Phase Transition** in their own bodies. They will replicate the classic HKB (1984) experiment: wiggling fingers in anti-phase (opposing) and speeding up until they involuntarily switch to in-phase (symmetry). This proves that behavior is **Self-Organizing** (driven by stability), not **Prescribed** (driven by a motor program).

### Key Insight
"You didn't decide to switch. The system switched for you. The 'Anti-Phase' attractor died."

**Materials Needed**

**Activity:**
- [ ] Metronomes (Phone App) that can ramp up tempo.
- [ ] Desks for arm support.

**Empirical Snapshot:**
- [ ] **Kelso (1984) / HKB (1985)** - The Bifurcation Diagram.
- [ ] The Graph showing Relative Phase ($\phi$) jumping from 180° to 0°.

## Detailed Timeline

### 0:00-0:15 | Field Notes (Standard Opening)
**Routine:** Round-robin share
**Prompt:** "Where did you see 'Instability' this week? A wobble before a fall? A stutter before a change?"

### 0:15-0:45 | Part 1: The Activity (The Mystery)
**Goal:** Generate "Messy Data" on Phase Transitions.

**Protocol: The HKB Experiment**
1.  **Setup:** Rest arms on table. Extend index fingers.
2.  **Mode A (In-Phase):** Wiggle both fingers IN (flex) and OUT (extend) together. (Symmetry).
3.  **Mode B (Anti-Phase):** Wiggle one in, one out. (Windshield wipers).
4.  **The Ramp:** Start Metronome slow (1 Hz). Increase by 0.25 Hz every 10 seconds.
5.  **Task:** "Keep the pattern (Anti-Phase). Do not switch."
6.  **The Break:** At some critical speed (~2-3 Hz), the fingers will involuntarily snap into In-Phase.
7.  **Data:** Record the "Critical Frequency" where they failed.

**Protocol: The Hysteresis Check**
1.  Start FAST (in In-Phase). Slow down.
2.  Does it switch back to Anti-Phase? (No. It stays In-Phase).
3.  **Insight:** The path matters (Hysteresis).

### 0:45-0:65 | Part 2: The Empirical Snapshot (The Evidence)
**Goal:** Validate their experience with "Official Science."

**The Pivot:**
"You tried to stop it. You couldn't. Why? Did your brain give up?"

**The Artifact: The HKB Model**
*   **Show the Potential Landscape:**
    *   **Slow:** Two Valleys (0° and 180°). Both stable.
    *   **Fast:** The 180° valley gets shallower... and shallower... until it disappears (becomes a hill).
    *   **Result:** The ball (your fingers) rolls into the only valley left (0°).
*   **The Math:** This is a **Bifurcation**. A qualitative change caused by a quantitative scaling (speed).

**Discussion:**
*   "This proves the 'Central Executive' didn't do it. Physics did it."

### 0:65-0:75 | Part 3: Synthesis & Assignment
**Goal:** File the Dossier & Prime the Reading.

**Lab Worksheet:**
*   Draw the "Bifurcation Diagram" (One line splitting into two, or two merging to one).
*   Explain "Loss of Stability" in your own words.

**Reading Assignment (For Tuesday):**
*   **Read:** Blau & Wagman Ch 16 (Self-Organization) & 9 (Action).
*   **Read:** Kelso (1984) (Phase Transitions).
*   "Read the paper that changed the field."

## Post-Session Notes
*   Did everyone switch? (Some drummers/pianists can resist it longer).
