# Facilitator Script: Week 9 - Social Coordination

**Topic:** Interpersonal Synergies (Blau & Wagman Ch 11 + Richardson et al.)
**Goal:** Scale up. Prove that the laws of **Dynamics** (HKB) apply to **Groups**.

---

## 🕒 Activity 1: Warm-up - "The Break Debrief" (00:00 - 00:15)

**Setup:** Welcome back from Spring Break.

**🗣️ The Hook:**
> "Welcome back. Before the break, we proved that your left and right fingers coordinate via **Coupling**. They form a Synergy.
>
> **Question:** Does the coupling have to be *physical* (nerves/muscles)?
>
> What if the coupling is *informational* (light/sound)?
> Can I couple with **YOU** the same way my left hand couples with my right?"

## 🕒 Activity 2: Deep Dive - "Interpersonal Synergies" (00:15 - 00:35)

**🗣️ The Set-Up:**
> "Turn to Chapter 11. Richardson et al. (2007) did the HKB experiment, but with *two people*."

**✍️ The Prompt (Whiteboard):**
> "Draw the HKB setup again.
> **Condition A:** One person, two hands. (Coupled by Nerves).
> **Condition B:** Two people, one leg each. Watch each other. (Coupled by Light).
>
> **The Prediction:** If Dynamics are universal, the graph should look the same.
> **The Result:** It IS the same. People spontaneously synchronize. They Bifurcate. They show Hysteresis."

## 🕒 Activity 3: Core Activity - "Social Affordances" (00:35 - 01:00)

**Setup:** Moving beyond simple rhythm.

**Step 1: Joint Action**
> "It's not just swinging legs. It's moving furniture.
> If I carry a table with you, we become one system.
> **'The Social Unit of Analysis'**."

**Step 2: Passing Through**
> "Remember the Doorway (Stair Lab)?
> What if the doorway is blocked by another person?
> The affordance becomes 'Pass-Between-Able'.
> It depends on *their* behavior."

## 🕒 Activity 4: Forward Link - "The Sync" (01:00 - 01:20)

**🗣️ The Tease:**
> "You think you control your social behavior.
> But if I start clapping, you start clapping.
> If I walk fast, you walk fast.
>
> Is 'Empathy' just 'Resonance'?"

**The Bridge:**
> "On Thursday, we are going to test this.
> We are going to see if you can resist the **Social Magnet**.
> We'll play 'The Unintentional Sync'."

## 🕒 Activity 5: Closing (01:20 - 01:30)

**Minute Paper:**
> "If social behavior is self-organized, who is responsible for a mob riot? The individuals? Or the system dynamics?"
