# Facilitator Script: Week 5 - Affordances

**Topic:** The Theory of Affordances (Blau & Wagman Ch 5 + Gibson Ch 8)
**Goal:** Define **"Meaning"** in ecological terms. Shift from "Optical Structure" to "Opportunities for Action."

## 🕒 Activity 1: Warm-up - "The Ratio Debrief" (00:00 - 00:15)

**Setup:** Refer to last Thursday's **"Stair Lab"** results.

**🗣️ The Hook:**
> "On Thursday, we found the **Pi Number** ($0.88$).
> Regardless of how tall you were, the stairs became 'unclimbable' at the same ratio.
>
> **Question:** Where does the 'climbability' exist?
> Is it in the stairs? (No, giants can climb them).
> Is it in the mind? (No, short legs physically can't do it).
>
> **The Insight:** It exists in the **Relation**."

**🗣️ The Transition:**
> "Gibson calls these relations **Affordances**. They are real, objective opportunities for action. And today, we define them properly."

## 🕒 Activity 2: Deep Dive - "The Postbox Definition" (00:15 - 00:35)

**🗣️ The Set-Up:**
> "Gibson says: 'The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill.'
>
> Let's stress-test this. Look at a mailbox (or a trash can)."

**✍️ The Prompt (Whiteboard):**
> "List the affordances of a Mailbox."
> *(Expected: Mailing a letter).*
> "Now, imagine you are:
> 1.  A Squirrel.
> 2.  A Tank.
> 3.  A Terrorist.
>
> Does the object change? No. Do the affordances change? Yes.
>
> **The Key Concept:** Affordances are **Dispositional Properties**. They only become 'real' when the complement (the animal) is present."

## 🕒 Activity 3: Core Activity - "The False Dichotomy" (00:35 - 01:00)

**Setup:** We need to break the Subjective/Objective divide.

**Step 1: Objective vs. Subjective**
> "Physics is Objective (Mass, Length).
> Psychology is Subjective (Value, Meaning).
> Where do Affordances fit?"

**Step 2: The Ecological Patch**
> "Gibson says Affordances are **Both**. Or **Neither**.
> They cut across the dichotomy.
> *Example:* 'Edibility' is a fact of biology (Objective), but it describes value to me (Subjective).
>
> **Discussion:** Can an affordance exist if no one is there to perceive it?
> (The Tree in the Forest debate)."

## 🕒 Activity 4: Forward Link - "Haptics" (01:00 - 01:20)

**🗣️ The Tease:**
> "So far, we've only talked about **Vision**.
> But Gibson claimed *all* perceptual systems detect information.
>
> Close your eyes. (Hand them a pen/rod).
> Can you feel how long this is?
> How? You aren't touching the tip. You are only touching the handle."

**The Bridge:**
> "On Thursday, we are going to play **The Wielding Game**.
> We are going to see if your muscles can detect geometry just like your eyes can."

## 🕒 Activity 5: Closing (01:20 - 01:30)

**Minute Paper:**
> "Give an example of a **Negative Affordance** (something that affords injury/danger) and explain what property of the animal makes it dangerous."
