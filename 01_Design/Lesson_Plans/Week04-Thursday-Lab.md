# Week 4 Thursday: Instructor Guide
## "The Great Stair Lab" - Affordances & Body Scaling

**Date:** Thursday, February 5, 2026
**Duration:** 75 minutes
**Class Size:** 5 students
**Mode:** Primer (Data & Experience)

---

## Session Overview

### Pedagogical Goal
Students will discover that "climbability" is not a property of the stairs (physics) nor a property of the mind (opinion), but a **ratio** between the environment and the body (E/A). They will replicate Warren's (1984) classic finding that the transition from "climbable" to "unclimbable" happens at a constant ratio ($\pi$ number).

### Key Insight
"The world is measured in 'leg-lengths', not meters."

**Materials Needed**

**Activity:**
- [ ] Tape measures (one per pair).
- [ ] The "Great Staircase" (A location on campus with varying stair heights, or just a standard stairwell + some boxes/steps to simulate different heights).
- [ ] Camera/Phone.

**Empirical Snapshot:**
- [ ] **Warren (1984)** - Figure showing the "Critical Point" ($R/L = 0.88$).
- [ ] **Mark (1987)** - Figure showing the shift when wearing blocks (if applicable).

## Detailed Timeline

### 0:00-0:15 | Field Notes (Standard Opening)
**Routine:** Round-robin share
**Prompt:** "What affordance did you use today without thinking? Did you 'pass through' a door? Did you 'sit on' a ledge?"

---

### 0:15-0:45 | Part 1: The Activity (The Mystery)
**Goal:** Generate "Messy Data" on Climbability.

**Protocol: The Measuring Phase**
1.  **Metric 1:** Measure each student's **Leg Length (L)**. (From ground to hip joint).
2.  **Metric 2:** Find a set of stairs (or use adjustable boxes). Measure **Riser Height (R)**.

**Protocol: The Judgment Phase**
1.  **Task:** Look at a tall step/box. "Is this climbable without using hands?"
2.  **Action:** Try it. (Carefully!).
3.  **Data:** Record Yes/No for different heights.
4.  **The Critical Point:** Find the exact height where it shifts from "Easy" to "Hard" to "Impossible."

**Protocol: The "Giant" Simulation (Optional)**
1.  Stand on a lower step (simulating shorter legs). Does the next step look "taller"?
2.  "Does the affordance change when your eye height changes?"

---

### 0:45-0:65 | Part 2: The Empirical Snapshot (The Evidence)
**Goal:** Validate their experience with "Official Science."

**The Pivot:**
"You all have different leg lengths. So the 'Critical Height' was different for everyone.
But... is there a constant?"

**The Artifact: Warren (1984)**
*   **Show the Graph:** Probability of "Climbable" judgment vs. Riser Height.
*   **The Math:** "Warren found that if you divide Riser Height ($R$) by Leg Length ($L$), everyone breaks at the same number."
*   **The Pi Number:** $\pi = R/L = 0.88$.
*   **Conclusion:** "The perceptual system doesn't measure R. It measures $R/L$."

**Discussion:**
*   "This is a **dimensionless number**. It has no units (meters/feet cancel out). Why is that cool?"
*   (It means the information is universal).

### 0:65-0:75 | Part 3: Synthesis & Assignment
**Goal:** File the Dossier & Prime the Reading.

**Lab Worksheet:**
*   Calculate your own $R/L$ ratio for the "Impossible" step.
*   Does it match Warren's 0.88?

**Reading Assignment (For Tuesday):**
*   **Read:** Blau & Wagman Ch 5 (Affordances).
*   **Read:** Gibson (1979) Ch 8 (Theory of Affordances).
*   "You felt the ratio. Now read the theory that explains why 'meaning' is in the ratio."

---

## Post-Session Notes
*   Did we find a step tall enough to break the affordance?
*   Did anyone struggle with the "Ratio" concept?
