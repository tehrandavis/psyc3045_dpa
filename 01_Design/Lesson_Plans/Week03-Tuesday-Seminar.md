# Facilitator Script: Week 3 - Starting Over

**Topic:** The Ecological Axioms (Blau & Wagman Ch 3-4)
**Goal:** Formalize the "New Rules" of perception. Shift the metaphor from "Computer" to "Sunflower" (Resonance).

## 🕒 Activity 1: Warm-up - "The Action-Perception Split" (00:00 - 00:15)

**Setup:** Refer to last Thursday's **"Action vs. Perception"** Lab results.

**🗣️ The Hook:**
> "On Thursday, we saw something weird. Your eyes were fooled by the Ebbinghaus illusion (the chips looked different sizes), but your hands weren't (your grip aperture was accurate).
>
> This proves **Assumption #1** of our new theory: **Perception is for Action.**
>
> If you just 'look' at the world like a camera, you get lies. If you 'act' on the world, you get truth.
>
> **Question:** Why does moving/acting clarify the signal?"

**👂 Listen For:**
*   "Because you get more views?"
*   "Because action uses absolute metrics (my hand size) not relative ones."
*   "Because the information for action is different."

**🗣️ The Transition:**
> "Exactly. We need a theory that puts **Action** first. That's what Chapters 3 and 4 are about. We are 'Starting Over' with new assumptions."

## 🕒 Activity 2: Deep Dive - "The Sunflower Metaphor" (00:15 - 00:35)

**🗣️ The Set-Up:**
> "I want to give you a new metaphor. Think of a sunflower tracking the sun across the sky.
Does the sunflower have a 'map' of the sky in its brain? Does it calculate trajectory?
No. It is **mechanically coupled** to the light. It **resonates**.
>
> Ecological Psychology argues that humans are just sophisticated sunflowers."

**✍️ The Prompt (Whiteboard Challenge):**
> "Draw the **System**.
**Team A:** Draw the 'Computer' model of a person catching a ball (Input -> Process -> Output).
**Team B:** Draw the 'Sunflower' model (Coupling / Resonance).
>
> How do you draw 'Resonance'? How do you draw 'Direct'?"

*(Allow 5-7 minutes for drawing on board).*

**🗣️ The Discussion:**
> "Look at Team B's drawing. Where is the 'intelligence'?
In the Computer, the intelligence is in the box (the brain).
In the Sunflower, the intelligence is in the **System** (the relationship between plant and light).
>
> This is **Ecological Assumption #5**: The Animal-Environment System is the unit of analysis."

## 🕒 Activity 3: Core Activity - "The Axiom Gauntlet" (00:35 - 01:00)

**Setup:** We need to lock in the 3 big shifts from the reading.

**Concept 1: Richness of Stimulus**
> "Old view: Stimulus is impoverished (2D image).
New view: Stimulus is Rich (Ambient Optic Array).
**Discussion:** What is the 'Ambient Optic Array'? How is it different from a 'Retinal Image'?"
> *(Key Point: It surrounds you. It has structure. It exists even if you close your eyes.)*

**Concept 2: Direct Perception**
> "Old view: Mediated by a copy.
New view: Direct contact.
**Debate:** If I touch the table with a stick, do I feel the stick or the table?
(Turvey's point: You feel the table *at* the end of the stick. The tool becomes part of you. Perception extends *out*.)"

**Concept 3: Reciprocity**
> "Old view: World -> Senses -> Brain -> Muscles. (One way).
New view: Perception <-> Action. (Circular).
**Challenge:** Can you perceive without acting? (Try to see the room without moving your eyes. It fades to gray.)"

## 🕒 Activity 4: Forward Link - "The Mystery of Tau" (01:00 - 01:20)

**🗣️ The Tease:**
> "Okay, we have a nice philosophy. 'We are sunflowers.' 'Input is rich.'
But as scientists, we have to prove it. We have to find the **Variable**.
>
> If we don't calculate 'Time to Contact' using distance/velocity... what *do* we detect?"

**The Demo (Looming):**
*   Walk toward a student.
*   "What is happening to my image in your field of view?" (It expands).
*   "Is there a mathematically precise rate of expansion that tells you *exactly* when I will hit you?"

**🗣️ The Assignment:**
> "This variable is called **Tau ($\tau$)**.
On Thursday, we are going to measure it. We are going to visualize the math of the 'Sunflower' effect."

## 🕒 Activity 5: Closing (01:20 - 01:30)

**Minute Paper:**
> "Explain **'Direct Perception'** to your roommate who is a Computer Science major. They think the brain processes data. How do you tell them they are wrong in 2 sentences?"
