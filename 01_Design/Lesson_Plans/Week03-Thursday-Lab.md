# Week 3 Thursday: Instructor Guide
## "Visualizing Tau" - The Math of Looming

**Date:** Thursday, January 29, 2026
**Duration:** 75 minutes
**Class Size:** 5 students
**Mode:** Primer (Data & Experience)

---

## Session Overview

### Pedagogical Goal
Students will move from the philosophical claim ("Input is Rich") to the mathematical proof. They will experience **looming** and see how the rate of optical expansion ($\tau$) specifies time-to-contact, validating that the "Computer" (calculating distance/velocity) is unnecessary.

### Key Insight
"You don't need to know *where* the object is (distance) or *how fast* it's moving (velocity). You just need to detect how fast it is *growing* (expansion)."

**Materials Needed**

**Activity:**
- [ ] A balloon (to inflate) or a large flat disk on a stick.
- [ ] A smartphone with a slow-motion camera (most have this).
- [ ] A stopwatch.

**Empirical Snapshot:**
- [ ] **Lee & Reddish (1981)** - "Diving Gannets" Graph. (Showing wing retraction at constant $\tau$).
- [ ] **Savelsbergh et al. (1991)** - "Grasping Tau" (Deflating ball experiment).

## Detailed Timeline

### 0:00-0:15 | Field Notes (Standard Opening)
**Routine:** Round-robin share
**Prompt:** "Where did you see **'Flow'** this week? Did you notice the world streaming past your ears when you walked?"

---

### 0:15-0:45 | Part 1: The Activity (The Mystery)
**Goal:** Generate "Messy Data" on Time-to-Contact.

**Protocol: The "Flinch" Test**
1.  **Setup:** Student A stands 10 feet away. Student B holds a large flat object (or camera).
2.  **Action:** Student A runs toward Student B at constant speed.
3.  **Task:** Student B must say "NOW" exactly when they think A would hit them (if A didn't stop).
4.  **Variation:** A runs fast. A runs slow. A accelerates.
5.  **Observation:** Does Student B use distance? Or something else?

**Protocol: The Balloon Expansion (The Geometric Proof)**
1.  **Setup:** Film a balloon inflating in slow motion (simulates looming).
2.  **Analysis:** Look at the video.
    *   Frame 1: Size $A_1$.
    *   Frame 10: Size $A_{10}$.
    *   **Question:** Is the rate of growth constant? Or does it explode exponentially at the end? (It explodes).
3.  **Insight:** The *explosion* of the image is the signal.

### 0:45-0:65 | Part 2: The Empirical Snapshot (The Evidence)
**Goal:** Validate their experience with "Official Science."

**The Pivot:**
"You flinched when the image exploded. Is that a rule? Do animals use it?"

**The Artifact: Diving Gannets (Lee & Reddish, 1981)**
*   **Show the Graph:** The y-axis is "Time to Contact." The x-axis is "Height."
*   **The Story:** "These birds dive at 60mph into water. If they open wings too early, they drag. Too late, they break their necks."
*   **The Data:** They don't open at a set *height* (distance). They don't open at a set *speed* (velocity). They open at a set **Tau value**.
*   **Conclusion:** They are surfing the optical flow field.

**Discussion:**
*   "Why is Tau safer than calculating distance? (Distance requires knowing size. Tau doesn't)."

---

### 0:65-0:75 | Part 3: Synthesis & Assignment
**Goal:** File the Dossier & Prime the Reading.

**Lab Worksheet:**
*   Sketch the "Looming Curve" (Exponential growth of the image).
*   Define $\tau$ in your own words.

**Reading Assignment (For Tuesday):**
*   **Read:** Blau & Wagman Ch 6 (Ecological Optics).
*   **Read:** Gibson (1979) Ch 1 (The Environment).
*   "Now you've felt the flow. Read Chapter 6 to learn the vocabulary."

---

## Post-Session Notes
*   Did the balloon video clear up the "Exponential" concept?
*   Do they understand why calculating distance is fragile?
