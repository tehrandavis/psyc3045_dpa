# Week 2 Tuesday: Instructor Guide
## "The Pivot" - From Computer to Ecology

**Date:** Tuesday, January 20, 2026
**Duration:** 75 minutes
**Class Size:** 5 students
**Mode:** The Reveal (Seminar)

## Session Overview

### Pedagogical Goal
Transition students from *Deconstruction* (Week 1: "The Computer Fails") to *Reconstruction* (Week 2: "Starting Over"). Use their own homework (Real World Challenge) to prove that the "Traditional Assumptions" are logically impossible in the real world, necessitating a new set of axioms.

### Key Insight
"You survived your drive to campus. Therefore, the theory that says you can't perceive the world must be wrong."

## Detailed Timeline

### 0:00-0:15 | Reading Quiz & Discussion Strategy
**Activity:** Administer the reading check quiz (5 mins), then use the discussion prompts to transition into the "Real World" activity.

**Reading Check Quiz (Blau & Wagman Ch 1-2):**
1.  **The "Traditional" Assumptions**
    In Chapter 1, the authors list 8 assumptions of the traditional approach. Which of the following is **NOT** one of them?
    *   A) The world actually exists (Realism).
    *   B) We are born with no knowledge (Tabula Rasa).
    *   C) Perception is direct and unmediated.
    *   D) The copy delivered to the brain is bad and needs to be fixed.

2.  **The Infinite Regress**
    What is the primary logical problem with the "Central Executive" (or Homunculus) relying on a mental representation to perceive the world?
    *   A) It assumes the Central Executive is smarter than the person.
    *   B) It requires a "loan of intelligence"—the executive needs knowledge of the world to interpret the bad copy, but has no way to get that knowledge without already having interpreted it.
    *   C) The Central Executive operates too slowly to catch a moving object.
    *   D) It violates the assumption of Realism.

3.  **Causality**
    How does the Ecological approach conceptualize causality differently from the Traditional approach?
    *   A) Traditional is linear (A causes B); Ecological is circular/systemic (like legs of a table supporting an event).
    *   B) Traditional is magical; Ecological is scientific.
    *   C) Traditional relies on gravity; Ecological relies on friction.
    *   D) There is no difference; both use efficient causality.

4.  **The Retinal Image Fallacy**
    Why is the "Retinal Image" considered a fallacy, especially when comparing humans to flies?
    *   A) Flies are too small to have retinas.
    *   B) Flies have compound eyes that do not form a coherent image on a surface, yet they perceive fine. Therefore, an image isn't necessary for perception.
    *   C) Humans actually have compound eyes, we just don't realize it.
    *   D) The image in a human eye is actually right-side up, contrary to popular belief.

5.  **Poverty of the Stimulus**
    The "Beuchet Chair" illusion is used by traditionalists to prove the stimulus is impoverished. How do the authors counter this?
    *   A) By admitting it's a perfect illusion that cannot be solved.
    *   B) By arguing that the illusion only works if you are static (motionless) and view it from one specific point with one eye. Once you move, the illusion breaks.
    *   C) By saying the chair is actually just a painting.
    *   D) By claiming that "chairs" don't exist in nature.

**Discussion Prompts (To bridge to the "Real World Challenge"):**
*   **The "Loan of Intelligence":** If the traditional approach relies on "unconscious inference" to fix a bad retinal image, where does the knowledge to make that inference come from? Why do the authors call this a "theoretical dead end"?
*   **The Definition of "Stimulus":** The authors argue that Traditional Psychology treats a **static, disembodied observer** as the default (the "camera" model). How does changing this default to a **moving, active animal** solve the "Poverty of the Stimulus"?
*   **The "Copy" vs. "Relational" Variables:** Traditional approaches look for **objective properties** (size in meters). Ecological approaches look for **relational properties** (horizon ratio). Why is an "objective" copy of the world actually *less* useful to an organism?
*   **The Role of Constraints:** In Chapter 2, the authors replace "Instincts" with "Constraints" (body shape, niche). How is "inheriting a niche" different from "inheriting a mental program"?
*   **The "Crisis" of Psychology:** The authors claim we need to "Start Over" because the 8 Traditional Assumptions are fundamentally flawed. Do you agree that a scientific field can be based on false assumptions for centuries?

### 0:15-0:40 | Part 1: The Audit (Real World Challenge Debrief)
**Activity:** Students take out their "Real World Challenge" homework.

**Whiteboard Strategy:**
Create 3 columns: **The Task**, **The Computer's Problem**, **The Result**.

1.  **Ask Student A:** "What was your task?" (e.g., Driving).
2.  **Ask:** "What math did the robot need?" (e.g., Velocity, Distance).
3.  **The Trap:** "Which trap did it hit?" (e.g., Processing Time - "I'd crash before I calculated").
4.  **The Result:** "Did *you* crash?" (No).

**The Punchline:**
"Look at this board. According to the theory in Chapter 1, every one of these tasks is impossible. You should all be dead. Yet here you are. **The theory is wrong.**"

### 0:40-0:65 | Part 2: Starting Over (The New Axioms)
**Lecture/Discussion:** Building the new foundation (Chapter 3/4 content).

**1. The "Start Over" Prompt:**
"If we assume the world is real, and we assume we can know it... we have to change the rules."

**2. The New Rules (Whiteboard Contrast):**

| Traditional (Computer) | Ecological (Sunflower) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Input:** Poor / Ambiguous | **Input:** Rich / Specific |
| **Mechanism:** Computation / Inference | **Mechanism:** Detection / Resonance |
| **Causality:** Linear (A -> B) | **Causality:** Circular / System |
| **Separation:** Animal vs. Environment | **Unity:** Animal-Environment System |

**3. The Metaphor:**
"A sunflower doesn't compute the sun's position. It doesn't have a 'map' of the sky. It is mechanically *coupled* to the light. It resonates. We are sophisticated sunflowers."

---

### 0:65-0:75 | Part 3: The Setup for Thursday
**The Tease:**
"We just claimed that 'Input is Rich.' That light carries the truth. That sounds like magic. Can we prove it?"

**The Setup:**
"On Thursday, we are going to test two visual systems. One that lies (Perception) and one that tells the truth (Action). We'll see if your hand is smarter than your eye."

**Assignments:**
1.  **Read:** Haffenden (2001) - Intro & Figures only.
2.  **Read:** Blau & Wagman Ch 6 (Ecological Optics) - Start it (due next Tue).

## Post-Session Notes
*   Did they buy the "Systems" metaphor?
*   Are they ready to accept "Direct Perception" or still skeptical?
