# Week 9 Thursday: Instructor Guide
## "The Unintentional Sync" - Social Entrainment

**Date:** Thursday, March 12, 2026
**Duration:** 75 minutes
**Class Size:** 5 students
**Mode:** Primer (Data & Experience)

---

## Session Overview

### Pedagogical Goal
Students will discover that **Coordination** is not just an internal motor program but an interpersonal phenomenon. By swinging pendulums while watching a partner, they will experience **Spontaneous Entrainment** (unintentional synchronization), proving that visual information acts as a coupling force.

### Key Insight
"I didn't try to match you. The light made me do it."

---

**Materials Needed**

**Activity:**
- [ ] Handheld pendulums (weighted strings).
- [ ] Chairs arranged in pairs (facing each other).
- [ ] Blindfolds (to break the coupling).

**Empirical Snapshot:**
- [ ] **Richardson et al. (2007)** - The "Rocking Chairs" or "Pendulum" graphs.
- [ ] **Schmidt & O'Brien (1997)** - The visual coupling phase plots.

## Detailed Timeline

### 0:00-0:15 | Field Notes (Standard Opening)
**Routine:** Round-robin share
**Prompt:** "Did you sync up with anyone this week? Walking in step? Clapping? Yawning?"

---

### 0:15-0:45 | Part 1: The Activity (The Mystery)
**Goal:** Generate "Messy Data" on Social Sync.

**Protocol: The Pendulum Duel**
1.  **Setup:** Student A and Student B sit facing each other. Each holds a pendulum.
2.  **Condition 1 (No Vision):** Close eyes. Swing at "comfortable" tempo.
    *   *Result:* Drifting phase. No sync.
3.  **Condition 2 (Vision):** Open eyes. Look at your partner's pendulum. Swing "comfortably." **DO NOT TRY TO SYNC.**
    *   *Result:* They will lock into In-Phase (0°) or Anti-Phase (180°).
4.  **Condition 3 (Perturbation):** Student A speeds up. Does Student B follow?

**Protocol: The Walk**
1.  **Setup:** Two students walk side-by-side. Talk about the weather.
2.  **Observation:** Watch their feet. Do they lock step? (Usually yes).

### 0:45-0:65 | Part 2: The Empirical Snapshot (The Evidence)
**Goal:** Validate their experience with "Official Science."

**The Pivot:**
"You swore you weren't trying to sync. But the data says you did."

**The Artifact: Richardson et al. (2007)**
*   **Show the Graph:** Relative Phase ($\phi$) distribution.
*   **The Spikes:** Big peaks at 0° and 180°. Flat everywhere else.
*   **The Explanation:** Visual information acts like a physical spring. It couples the two oscillators.
*   **The "Social" Connection:** This is the math of rapport.

**Discussion:**
*   "If vision is a 'coupling force', does staring at someone essentially physically touch them?"

---

### 0:65-0:75 | Part 3: Synthesis & Assignment
**Goal:** File the Dossier & Prime the Reading.

**Lab Worksheet:**
*   Did you feel the "pull" of the other pendulum?
*   How is this different from the Finger Wiggling (internal)? How is it the same?

**Reading Assignment (For Tuesday):**
*   **Read:** Rietveld & Kiverstein (2014) - "A Rich Landscape of Affordances."
*   **Note:** We are moving to **Cultural Affordances** (The Landscape).

---

## Post-Session Notes
*   Did the "Unintentional" instruction work? (Crucial they don't *try* to sync).
