# Work Log: Dynamics of Perception & Action

## Tuesday, January 27, 2026 (Pre-Class Prep)
**Session Focus:** Finalized materials for Week 3 Tuesday Seminar - Action vs. Perception

### Discussion Materials
- **Created discussion questions** for Axioms & Planimeters section (4 questions targeting Axioms 3, 6, 8, 9)
- **Generated answer key** with theoretical grounding from Blau & Wagman Ch 3-4 (via Gemini analysis)
- **Revised lesson plan structure**: Removed standalone "Pivot" section; integrated Michaels (2000) task-specificity argument into Question 1 facilitation notes
- **Updated timing**: Lab (20-25 min) → Discussion (35-40 min, with Q1 as 10-12 min pivot) → Optics Prime (10-15 min)

### Lab Packet Development
- **Created comprehensive lab packet** (`Week_03_Lab_Packet_Ebbinghaus_Suite.md`) combining 3 activities:
  - **Activity 1: Perception Task** - Integrated computerized Ebbinghaus susceptibility test (Python script from `99_Demos/`)
  - **Activity 2: Grasping Task** - Immediate vs. delayed (5-sec) conditions to test memory effect
  - **Activity 3: Fitts Task** - Corrected design: 3 context conditions (none/large/small) × 2 target sizes (2cm/3cm) × 3 trials
- **Created instructor guide** (`Week_03_Lab_Guide_Instructor_Notes.md`) with procedures, timing, and expected results
- **Developed teaching templates** (generalized protocols for future use):
  - `Discussion_Day_Protocol.md` - Question-driven seminar (JiTT model)
  - `Activity_Day_Protocol.md` - POE (Predict-Observe-Explain) framework
  - `Weekly_Planning_Template.md` - Integration patterns for semester arc

### Key Pedagogical Decisions
- **Computerized susceptibility scoring** provides quantitative individual data (50-70% typical)
- **Grasping memory delay** isolates current visual info vs. representational memory
- **Fitts matched-context design** tests whether illusory size affects motor control when both targets have same context
- **Q1 as pivot moment**: Students discover task-specificity through facilitated discussion (not lecture)

## Thursday, January 30, 2026
**Session Focus:** Week 3 Canvas page finalization and student scaffolding resources

### Canvas Page Updates
- **Revised introduction**: Replaced "Snow Day" framing with general topic introduction using conversational tone
- **Swapped reading**: Replaced Savelsbergh et al. (1991) with Warren et al. (2001) for steering control application
- **Added reading #2**: Golonka & Wilson blog post "What Kind of Thing is Information?" as conceptual bridge between theory and applications
- **Revised reading descriptions**: Condensed all readings to match question-based style (key terms + prompting questions)

### Literature & Analysis (via Gemini)
- **Warren et al. (2001) literature note**: Created comprehensive note with methodology, findings, control law explanation
- **Reading load assessment**: Analyzed all three Week 3 readings (~23 pages total, 2.5-3 hours estimated)
  - Methodology: Weighted density approach accounting for equations, graphs, writing style, cognitive load
  - Identified bottlenecks: Warren's control law equation ("math cliff"), terminology shifts between papers
- **Week 3 Instructor Guide**: Created comprehensive teaching resource with:
  - Reading summaries with teaching notes
  - Bottleneck identification and mitigation strategies
  - Discussion questions and assessment guidance

### Student Scaffolding Resources
- **Warren 2001 Cheat Sheet**: Created equation decoder with:
  - Plain-English symbol breakdown (turning rate, gain, direction/flow errors, weight factor)
  - "Mixing ingredients" analogy for linear combination
  - Trust factor ($w$) table showing environmental weighting
  - Clear "Don't need to do" vs. "DO need to understand" guidance
- **Lee & Aronson 1974 Cheat Sheet**: Created with prompting questions instead of stating findings:
  - "What to Look For in the Results" (pattern questions, control loop logic)
  - "Think About the Manipulation" questions
  - Revised from stating observations to guiding discovery

### Key Pedagogical Decisions
- **Question-driven scaffolding**: Both cheat sheets use leading questions rather than explanations
- **Reading progression**: Theory (Blau & Wagman) → Concept (Golonka & Wilson) → Applications (Lee & Aronson, Warren)
- **Math anxiety mitigation**: Warren cheat sheet explicitly addresses equation fear with conceptual focus
- **Active learning**: Students must discover patterns in results rather than being told findings

### Next Session Todo
- [x] Create Week 3 Reading Quiz #teaching #p/dpa-s26 📅 2026-01-30

## Saturday, January 31, 2026
**Session Focus:** Week 3 Reading Quiz and Resource Compilation

### Resource Compilation
- **Created `module_3_resources.md`**: Compiled all Week 3 readings and materials into a single reference document with direct file paths and links.
    - Integrated content from Literature Notes (Blau & Wagman Ch 6, Warren 2001, Lee & Aronson 1974) and Cheat Sheets.
    - Added "What Kind of Thing is Information?" (Golonka & Wilson) summary.

### Assessment Creation
- **Created Week 3 Reading Quiz** (`Week_03_Reading_Quiz.md`):
    - Developed 5 multiple-choice questions covering all assigned resources.
    - Formatted with **Correct Answer = Option A** for easy Canvas importing.
    - Added **Citation Prologue** to the quiz file, referencing specific page numbers (e.g., Warren p. 215, Blau & Wagman p. 102) for all answers.

### Document Format Conversion
- **Converted Warren 2001 Cheat Sheet to Typst** (`Warren_2001_Cheat_Sheet_FINAL.typ`):
    - Migrated from Markdown to Typst format for improved typesetting and PDF generation.
    - Preserved all original language and pedagogical scaffolding (equation decoder, "mixing ingredients" analogy, trust factor table).
    - Fixed formatting errors (typo in section header, stray closing bracket).
    - Configured for US letter with Linux Libertine font, 11pt.
