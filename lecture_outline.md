# Lecture Outline: Ecological Optics & Information
## Goal: From "Light as Energy" to "Light as Information"

### Slide 1: Title Slide
*   Title: Module 03: Ecological Optics
*   Subtitle: The Geometry of Information
*   Note: Introduce the shift from Axioms (Theory) to Mechanics (How it works).

### Slide 2: The Core Problem
*   Visual: Computer Vision vs. Ecological Vision.
*   Content:
    *   **Old View:** Light is just "energy" that hits the eye. Brain must calculate.
    *   **Ecological View:** Light is "structured" by the world. Structure *is* information.
    *   **Key Distinction:** Radiant Light (Energy/Physics) vs. Ambient Light (Information/Ecology).

### Slide 3: The Optic Array (Blau & Wagman)
*   Visual: Diagram of an observer in a room with light rays converging.
*   Content:
    *   Texture, Occlusion, Perspective.
    *   It's a "quilt" of angles at the eye.
    *   We sample this array to perceive the world.

### Slide 4: Visual Proprioception (Lee & Aronson)
*   Visual: Photo/Video of the "Moving Room" experiment.
*   Content:
    *   **The Experiment:** Moving walls, stationary floor.
    *   **The Result:** Infants (and adults!) sway/fall.
    *   **The Lesson:** Vision isn't just for objects; it's our primary sense of *self-motion* (Proprioception).
    *   **Why?** Global flow overrides mechanical signals from feet.

### Slide 5: What is Information? (Golonka & Wilson / Savelsbergh)
*   Visual: The Deflating Ball Experiment.
*   Content:
    *   **Indirect View:** Calculate Distance / Velocity ($T = D/V$).
    *   **Direct View:** Detect Rate of Expansion ($	au$).
    *   **Evidence:** When ball deflates, $	au$ says "far away."
    *   **Result:** People grasp LATE. They trust the optic variable ($	au$), not the physical distance.

### Slide 6: Control of Steering (Warren et al.)
*   Visual: VR "Prism" Experiment setup (Flow vs. Direction).
*   Content:
    *   **The Conflict:** Prism shifts flow 10° from walking direction.
    *   **The Debate:** Do we center the target (Egocentric) or align with flow (FOE)?
    *   **The Finding:** It's BOTH.
    *   **Adaptive Weighting:**
        *   No texture? Use Direction.
        *   Rich texture (Forest)? Use Flow.
    *   **Significance:** Perception is flexible and adaptive, not a rigid rule.

### Slide 7: Seeing "Impact" (Kim et al. / Tau-dot)
*   Visual: Breaking/Stopping car or runner.
*   Content:
    *   It's not just *when* (Tau), but *how hard* (Tau-dot).
    *   $\\\dot{\\tau} \\ge -0.5$: Soft stop (Safe).
    *   $\\\dot{\\tau} < -0.5$: Hard crash (Unsafe).
    *   We perceive "crashiness" directly from the optics.

### Slide 8: Summary / Discussion
*   Visual: The Perception-Action Loop diagram.
*   Content:
    *   We don't "process" light; we "detect" invariants.
    *   We use these invariants (Flow, Tau, Tau-dot) to control action.
    *   **Discussion Q:** If vision is proprioceptive, why do we still need vestibular/haptic senses? (Robustness).
