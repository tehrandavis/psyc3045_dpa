# 📖 Course Bible: Dynamics of Perception & Action (Spring 2026)

## 📌 Course Identity
*   **Course:** PSYC 3045 - Dynamics of Perception & Action
*   **Instructor:** Tehran Davis
*   **Philosophy:** **"The Computer vs. The Organism"**. Challenging the computational metaphor of the mind. Moving from the geometry of information (Ecological Psychology) to the physics of coordination (Dynamical Systems) to contemporary applications in robotics and neuroscience.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
1.  **Evaluate:** Critically compare competing theories of perception-action (Direct Perception vs. Predictive Processing/Internal Models).
2.  **Apply:** Use dynamical systems concepts (attractors, phase transitions, hysteresis) to explain real-world behavioral changes.
3.  **Analyze:** Solve motor control problems (Bernstein's Degrees of Freedom) through the lens of synergies and coordinative structures.
4.  **Synthesize:** Connect classical ecological theory to modern frontiers like Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) and neural mechanisms (Affordance Competition).

## 🥁 Course Cadence (The Setup-Payoff Loop)
The course operates on a strict weekly rhythm designed to bridge abstract theory with physical experience:

*   **Tuesdays (The Setup):**
    *   **Review:** Seminar-style discussion of assigned readings.
    *   **Foreshadow:** "Intuition Pumps" and introductory lecture providing the framework for the next concept.
*   **Thursdays (The Payoff):**
    *   **Experience:** Interactive Demonstration / Lab (Ecological Optics, Wielding, etc.).
    *   **Deep Dive:** Detailed lecture and discussion connecting the physical experience back to the readings and theory.
*   **Fridays:** Major Deliverables (Thought Papers / Curation Checks).

## 🗺️ Structural Roadmap
*   **Part I: Ecological Foundations (Weeks 1-5)** - The geometry of information. Direct perception, Tau, and the Theory of Affordances.
*   **Part II: The Dynamical Turn (Weeks 6-8)** - The mathematics of coordination. Dynamic touch, HKB model, and the degrees of freedom problem.
*   **Part III: The Modern Synthesis (Weeks 9-13)** - Scaling up. Social coordination, skilled intentionality, and the great debate (Eco vs. PP).
*   **Part IV: Applications & Frontiers (Weeks 14-15)** - Robotics, Human-Machine Teaming, and final Consultant Reports.
