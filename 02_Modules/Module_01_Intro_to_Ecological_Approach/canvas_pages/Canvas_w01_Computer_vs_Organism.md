# Module 01 - The Computer vs. The Organism

## Weekly Overview

Welcome to Dynamics of Perception & Action. Before we can understand *how* organisms perceive and act, we must address a fundamental question about the nature of the mind: **Is the brain a computer?**

This week establishes the "Standard Story" of cognitive science—that the mind processes information like software processes data—and immediately challenges it with the "Ecological Alternative." We will explore why the computer metaphor is so seductive, why it leads to the problem of the "homunculus" (a little man in the head making decisions), and why it fails to explain high-speed, robust behavior in the real world.

We will introduce the "Poverty of the Stimulus" argument—the idea that sensory input is so bad that the brain *must* fix it—and contrast it with the Ecological claim that information is rich, lawful, and available directly to anyone who moves.

**By the end of this week, here's what you should be able to do:**

*   **Critique the "Computer Metaphor":** Explain why treating the mind as an information processor leads to the "homunculus problem" (infinite regress).
*   **Analyze the "Poverty of the Stimulus":** Describe the traditional view that the retinal image is ambiguous (2D, static) and why this forces theories to rely on inference and guessing.
*   **Contrast "Computation" with "Law-Based Control":** Using the "Outfielder Problem" as a case study, explain why calculating trajectory is fragile while coupling movement to optical variables (like OAC) is robust.
*   **Articulate the "Ecological Pivot":** Why do we need to stop asking "how does the brain process?" and start asking "what information is available?"

## Required Readings (For Next Tuesday)

*Note: There are no readings due for the first class (Thursday, Jan 15). These readings are assigned on Thursday to be completed before our seminar on Tuesday, Jan 20.*

As you are reading, consider...

**1. The "Little Man" Problem**
If the brain needs to interpret the eye's image, who is doing the interpreting? And who interprets *that* interpreter's interpretation? Why is the concept of a "Central Executive" (or Homunculus) considered a theoretical dead end in Chapter 2?

**2. Local vs. Complex Causality**
Traditional psychology assumes linear causality (A touches B). Blau & Wagman argue for "complex, nonlinear causality" (like legs of a table). How does this shift allow us to explain action-at-a-distance (e.g., Fred seeing the tree) without needing a "copy" in the head? Why is this an issue in the first place?

**3. Is the Stimulus Actually Poor?**
Traditional theories assume the retinal image is ambiguous (e.g., the Beuchet Chair illusion). Blau & Wagman argue this is only true if you stand perfectly still. How does **movement** change the problem? Why do they say movement is "the feature, not the bug"?

**4. The Animal-Environment System**
Chapter 2 argues that we cannot define an animal without its environment, or an environment without its animal (the "Niche"). Why is this "Dualism" (separating the two) a problem for psychology? How does treating them as one system solve the "Outness" problem?
