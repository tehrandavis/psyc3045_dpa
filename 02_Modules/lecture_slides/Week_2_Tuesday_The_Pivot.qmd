## The Pivot

We just discussed the limits of the **Computer** model in the real world.
(Infinite Regress, Too Slow, Ambiguous).

If we want to better explain how you *actually* survived your drive here...

**We need a new Metaphor.**

## Metaphor 1: The Computer

*   **Input:** Poor (2D, Static, Ambiguous).
*   **Mechanism:** **Computation** (Inference, Calculation).
*   **Intelligence:** In the Head (The Software).
*   **Relationship:** **Indirect** (Mediated by a copy).

## Metaphor 2: The Sunflower

## Metaphor 2: The Sunflower

![](assets/coupled_sunflower.png){fig-align="center"}

*   **Input:** Rich (The Sun).
*   **Mechanism:** **Resonance** (Phototropism / Coupling).
*   **Intelligence:** In the **System** (Plant + Light).
*   **Relationship:** **Direct** (Mechanical linkage).

---

## Concept: The Animal-Environment System

The biggest mistake of the Computer model was **Dualism**:
Treating the *Animal* and the *Environment* as separate things.

*   **Old View:** Animal $\leftarrow$ Gap $\rightarrow$ Environment
*   **New View:** **Animal-Environment System**

::: {.callout-note}
"You cannot define an animal without its niche. You cannot define a niche without an animal." (Blau & Wagman, Ch 3)

## The Consequence: Changing the Question

If the **System** is the unit, we stop asking about the brain processing inputs.
We start asking about the relationship.

**Bill Mace's Rule:**

> "Ask not what's inside your head, but what your head is inside of."

We are inside an **Ambient Optic Array**.
*   We don't measure *Distance* (Physics).
*   We measure *Relational Structure* (Ecology).

## Concept: Measuring Directly

**The Polar Planimeter Metaphor:**
A tool that measures Area directly without measuring Length or Width.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Smart vs. Dumb Instruments:**

*   **Smart** about the goal (Area).
*   **Dumb** about the components (Length).

**Ecological Insight:**

We are **Smart** about Catching (Tau) but **Dumb** about Distance.
We perceive the *useful* variable directly.

## Concept: Self-Organization

**The Orchestra Problem:**
How do musicians play together?

*   **Model A (Central Executive):** Dr. Pick conducts. Everyone watches him. (Top-Down).
*   **Model B (Self-Organization):** Dr. Pick is sick. Everyone listens to their neighbor. (Bottom-Up).

## The New Axioms (Starting Over)

| The Standard Story | The Ecological Approach |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Poverty** of Stimulus | **Richness** of Stimulus |
| **Ambiguous** Input | **Lawful** Information |
| **Linear** Causality | **Circular/System** Causality |
| **Computation** | **Detection / Resonance** |
| **Indirect** Perception | **Direct** Perception |

## A Mystery for Thursday: The Two Visual Systems

If the Ecological approach is right, **Perception is for Action**.

*   **Standard View:** We see the world to build a picture (Perception). Then we act on that picture.
*   **Ecological View:** We see the world to move.

**The Test:** Can your hand be smarter than your eye?

## Haffenden et al (2001)

![](assets/ebbing_illusion.png){fig-align="center"}

*   **Perception:** "The middle circles look different sizes." (Illusion).
*   **Action:** "When you pick them up, does your hand make the same mistake?"

---

**Thursday's Meeting:** We will test if **Action** breaks the Illusion.
