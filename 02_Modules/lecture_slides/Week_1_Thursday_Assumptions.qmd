## The Roadmap

We are going to walk through **8 Assumptions** that traditional psychology makes about how you know the world.

We will see how each assumption forces us into a corner, eventually leading to impossible problems.

::: {.callout-note}
## The Goal
To understand why we need a **radical alternative** (Ecological Psychology).
:::

---

## Assumption 1: The World Exists {auto-animate=true}

<div class="assumption-box">
**Assumption 1:** The world actually exists.
</div>

-   Realism.
-   Not a simulation.
-   Not a hallucination.

**Why we keep this:**
If the world *doesn't* exist, science is pointless. We have to assume there is something out there to study.

<div class="interactive-prompt">
Is this controversial? (Usually no.)
</div>

---

## Assumption 2: The Blank Slate {auto-animate=true}

<div class="assumption-box">
**Assumption 2:** We are born with no knowledge. All knowledge comes through the senses.
</div>

-   *Tabula Rasa* (Locke).
-   Empiricism.

**The Implication:**
If you weren't born knowing it, you must have *learned* it through your eyes, ears, skin, etc.

<div class="interactive-prompt">
**Discussion:** If a baby chick knows to peck at grain immediately after hatching, does this violate Assumption 2?
</div>

---

## Assumption 3: The Senses Inform Us {auto-animate=true}

<div class="assumption-box">
**Assumption 3:** Our senses (somehow) inform us about the world.
</div>

-   The only bridge between "in here" (mind) and "out there" (world).
-   If the bridge is broken, we know nothing.

**The Trap Begins:**
If the senses are the *only* path, we better hope they are accurate.

<div class="interactive-prompt">
**Think:** Have your senses ever lied to you? (Optical illusions, dreams?)
</div>

---

## Assumption 4: Local Causality {auto-animate=true}

<div class="assumption-box">
**Assumption 4:** All causality must be local.
</div>

-   **The Rule:** To cause something, you must *touch* it.
-   **Example:** A billiard ball hitting another ball.

**The Problem:**
I can see the tree, but I am not touching the tree.
How can the tree cause my behavior if it doesn't touch me?

<div class="interactive-prompt">
**Activity:** Try to move a pencil on your desk without touching it. (You can't.)
Now, look at the pencil. Did it "move" your mind? How?
</div>

---

## Assumption 5: The Mediated Copy {auto-animate=true}

<div class="assumption-box">
**Assumption 5:** Contact with the world is mediated by a COPY.
</div>

-   Because of Assumption 4 (Local Causality), the tree can't touch my brain.
-   **Solution:** The tree sends light $\rightarrow$ light touches eye $\rightarrow$ eye makes a COPY (Retinal Image).
-   **Result:** You never see the tree. You see the *copy*.

> "We are locked in a prison of our own representations."

---

## Assumption 6: The Copy is Bad {auto-animate=true}

<div class="assumption-box">
**Assumption 6:** The copy delivered to the brain is BAD.
</div>

-   **The "Poverty of the Stimulus"**
-   2D (World is 3D)
-   Inverted (World is upright)
-   Distorted (Peripheral vision is blurry)

**The Crisis:**
If the only link to the world (the copy) is broken garbage... how do we survive?

<div class="interactive-prompt">
**Visual:** Look at this photo of a "Beuchet Chair." It looks like a chair.
(Reveal: It is actually a scattered mess of parts.)
**Point:** Your eye lied.
</div>

---

## Assumption 7: Unconscious Inference {auto-animate=true}

<div class="assumption-box">
**Assumption 7:** The brain must FIX the bad copy using INFERENCE.
</div>

-   **Helmholtz:** The brain is a detective.
-   It uses clues + rules to *guess* what is out there.
-   **Calculation:** `Ambiguous Image` + `Rule (Perspective)` = `3D Cube`.

**The Cost:**
This requires massive computing power. The "Loan of Intelligence."

<div class="interactive-prompt">
**Activity:** Catch this ball!
**Traditional View:** Your brain just solved calculus equations for velocity, gravity, and wind resistance in 200ms. Did it?
</div>

---

## Assumption 8: The Representation {auto-animate=true}

<div class="assumption-box">
**Assumption 8:** Your experience is of the FIXED REPRESENTATION, not the world.
</div>

-   You don't see the raw data (it's upside down).
-   You don't feel the inference process (it's unconscious).
-   You only see the final product: The "simulation" your brain built.

::: {.callout-important}
## The Solipsism Trap
If you only ever see your brain's simulation... how do you know the real world is actually there?
:::

---

## The Summary of the Trap

1.  **Local Causality** $\rightarrow$ We need a Copy.
2.  **The Copy is Bad** $\rightarrow$ We need to Fix it.
3.  **Fixing requires Intelligence** $\rightarrow$ The Homunculus.
4.  **We only see the Fix** $\rightarrow$ We are trapped in the head.

**This is the "Standard Story" of Cognitive Science.**

---

## The Ecological Alternative

**What if we reject Assumption 4 (Local Causality)?**

-   What if we don't need a copy?
-   What if the input isn't bad?
-   What if we see the world *directly*?

**Next Class:**
How **Gibson** flipped the table on these assumptions.

<div class="interactive-prompt">
**Homework:** Read Blau & Wagman Ch 1-2. Find where they attack Assumption 6.
</div>
