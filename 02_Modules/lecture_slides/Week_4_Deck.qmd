## Recap: Action-Scaled World

We have seen that we perceive the world in terms of our **capabilities**.

-   **Optic Flow:** Where am I going? (Locomotion)
-   **Affordances:** What can I do? (Climbing, Passing through)
-   **Body Scaling:** How do I fit? (\(\pi\) numbers)

Today: How do we perceive the world **through** our body?

::: {.notes}
We are moving from vision to touch. But not just "feeling textures." We are talking about feeling the world by moving it.

## The Problem: The Blind Man's Cane

> "If a blind man uses a cane, he feels the sidewalk, not the cane." — Merleau-Ponty / Gibson

-   **Proximal Stimulus:** Pressure on the palm of the hand.
-   **Distal Perception:** The texture and distance of the sidewalk.

How do we perceive the **tip** of the tool when we are holding the **handle**?

::: {.notes}
This is the core mystery of tool use. When you use a hammer, you feel the nail. When you write, you feel the paper. The tool becomes part of your body.
:::

## Three Kinds of Touch

1.  **Cutaneous Touch:** (Passive)
    -   Stimulation of skin (heat, texture, pain).
    -   *Example:* A fly landing on your arm.
2.  **Haptic Touch:** (Active)
    -   Exploratory movement of hands.
    -   *Example:* Identifying a key in your pocket.
3.  **Dynamic Touch:** (Effortful)
    -   Muscular exertion / Wielding.
    -   *Example:* Swinging a tennis racket.

::: {.notes}
We are focusing on Dynamic Touch. This is the sense of muscular effort. It allows us to perceive objects that are too big to hold in our hands.
:::

## The Wielding Experiment

**Solomon & Turvey (1988)**

-   **Task:** Hold a rod behind a curtain. Wield it (wrist only).
-   **Question:** How long is it?
-   **Result:** Participants are incredibly accurate (\(r^2 = .99\)).

:::{.fragment}
**Crucial Point:** They never see the rod. They never touch the tip. They only feel the forces in the handle.
:::

::: {.notes}
This proves that the "length" of the object is specified by the forces required to move it. But which forces?
:::

## Hypothesis 1: Is it Mass (Weight)?

If I give you a heavy rod and a light rod, does the heavy one feel longer?

-   **Not necessarily.**
-   A short, heavy steel rod feels *short and heavy*.
-   A long, light wooden rod feels *long and light*.

**Conclusion:** Mass alone does not specify length.

## The Physics of Rotation

When you wield an object, you are **rotating** it.
To rotate an object, you must overcome its resistance to rotation.

**Moment of Inertia (\(I\)):**
$$ I = m \times d^2 $$

-   \(m\) = Mass (How heavy is it?)
-   \(d\) = Distance of mass from axis of rotation (How far away is it?)

::: {.notes}
Look at the equation. Distance (\(d\)) is squared. This means that mass far away (at the tip) counts WAY more than mass near the hand.
:::

## Why Distance Matters

Imagine holding a sledgehammer.

1.  **Hold the handle:** Heavy head is far away (\(d\) is large). Hard to rotate. **Feels Long.**
2.  **Hold the head:** Heavy head is close (\(d\) is small). Easy to rotate. **Feels Short.**

The **Moment of Inertia** specifies the reachability of the object.

## The Inertia Tensor (\(I_{ij}\))

Objects aren't just lines. They are 3D shapes.
You can rotate them in 3 dimensions (Pitch, Yaw, Roll).

The **Inertia Tensor** is a \(3 \times 3\) matrix that captures resistance to rotation in all directions.

$$ I = \begin{bmatrix}
I_{xx} & I_{xy} & I_{xz} \\
I_{yx} & I_{yy} & I_{yz} \\
I_{zx} & I_{zy} & I_{zz}
\end{bmatrix} $$

::: {.notes}
Don't panic about the math. Just know this: The Tensor captures the geometry of the mass distribution. It tells your hand "this object resists twisting" (it's wide) or "this object resists swinging down" (it's long).
:::

## Perception via Dynamics

| Physics | Perception |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Moment of Inertia** (\(I\)) | $\rightarrow$ | **Length / Reach** |
| **Product of Inertia** (\(I_{xy}\)) | $\rightarrow$ | **Orientation / Bent-ness** |
| **Principal Axes** | $\rightarrow$ | **Sweet Spot** |

We detect the **invariant** physical dynamics (Inertia) to perceive the **variant** spatial properties (Length).

## Application: Tool Use

This is how we use tools.

-   When we pick up a tool, we "probe" its inertia tensor by wielding it.
-   We instantly know "how far it reaches" and "where the heavy part is."
-   The tool becomes a **transparent** extension of the body.

::: {.notes}
This connects back to Heidegger's "Ready-to-hand." The tool disappears. We perceive the world *through* the tool.
:::

## Next Class: Thursday

**Activity:** "The Wielding Game"

-   You will wield unseen objects.
-   You will predict their length and shape.
-   We will see if you are sensitive to the **Inertia Tensor**.
