## Recap: From Time to Possibility

Last week, we saw how **Time-to-Contact ($\tau$)** specifies *when* an event will happen.

Today, we ask a deeper question:  
**What can I do?**

-   Is that surface walk-on-able?
-   Is that object grasp-able?
-   Is that gap jump-over-able?

::: {.notes}
We are moving from the perception of events (collisions) to the perception of possibilities. This is the heart of Ecological Psychology.

## Definition of Affordance

> "The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill."
> — J.J. Gibson (1979, p. 127)

**Key Concept:**
Affordances are **properties of the environment** taken with reference to the **animal**.

::: {.notes}
Notice the language. It offers, it furnishes. It's not just "physics." It's physics *for* biology.
:::

## Subjective or Objective? 

Is "climb-ability" a fact about the stairs? Or a fact about me?

:::{.callout-note}
## Gibson's Answer
"An affordance is neither an objective property nor a subjective property; or it is both if you like... It cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective."
:::

It is a **Relational Property**.

::: {.notes}
This is the philosophical core. We are used to thinking of physics (objective) and psychology (subjective). Affordances break that wall.
:::

## Body Scaling

Imagine you are Alice in Wonderland.
You drink the potion and shrink to 6 inches tall.

-   The stairs haven't changed (Physics is constant).
-   But the **Affordance** has changed.
    -   The stairs are no longer "climb-able."
    -   They are now "cliff-like."

**Conclusion:** We measure the world in "body-units," not inches.

::: {.notes}
This means that standard metrics (meters, feet) are biologically irrelevant. The only metric that matters is your own body.
:::

## The Classic Study: Warren (1984)

**Question:** When does a step become "unclimbable"?

-   **Hypothesis:** It depends on your leg length ($L$).
-   **Experiment:**
    -   Group A: Short people.
    -   Group B: Tall people.
    -   Task: Look at stairs of different heights ($R$) and judge "Can you climb this without using your hands?"

::: {.notes}
William Warren wanted to prove that affordances are real, mathematical ratios.
:::

## The Results

If you plot the data in **Inches**:
-   Tall people stop at 30 inches.
-   Short people stop at 24 inches.
-   *The curves are different.*

If you plot the data in **Ratios** ($R/L$):
-   Everyone stops at **0.88**.
-   *The curves overlap perfectly.*

::: {.notes}
This was a bombshell. It showed that despite physical differences, the "perceptual category" was identical for everyone. It was defined by a dimensionless number.
:::

## The Pi Number ($\\pi$)

In physics, $\pi$ refers to a dimensionless ratio (like $C/D$).
In biology, we have "Intrinsic Metrics."

$$ \pi = \frac{Riser Height (R)}{Leg Length (L)} $$

-   **Critical Point (Max):** $R/L = 0.88$
-   **Optimal Point (Easiest):** $R/L = 0.26$

::: {.notes}
We don't just perceive the maximum. We perceive the optimal. The 0.26 ratio corresponds to the minimum metabolic cost. You perceive the "path of least resistance."
:::

## Mark (1987): Eye Height

How do you know how long your legs are? You don't look at them.

**Hypothesis:** Eye Height ($E$) specifies Leg Length ($L$).
If you are standing on 10cm blocks, you feel taller.
Does the world look "smaller"?

-   **Result:** Yes.
-   **Adaptation:** After walking for 10 minutes, people recalibrate.

::: {.notes}
This shows the system is flexible. If you wear platform shoes, the world's affordances change, and your perception updates to match your new "effectivities."
:::

## Summary: The Geometry of Action

1.  Perception is **Relational** (Animal-Environment).
2.  The units of perception are **Dimensionless Ratios** ($\\pi$ numbers).
3.  We perceive **Effectivities** (what we can do), not just properties (what things are).

::: {.notes}
We have now established the foundation. Perception is Direct (Week 2) and Scaled (Week 3). Next week, we look at Dynamic Touch—how we perceive the world by wielding tools.
:::

## Next Week: Dynamic Touch

**Reading:**
Turvey, M.T. & Carello, C. (1995). *Dynamic Touch.*

**Topic:**
How does a blind person "see" the sidewalk with a cane?
The answer lies in the **Inertia Tensor**.
