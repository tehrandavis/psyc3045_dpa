# Activity Guide: Affordance Competition Game
**Week 12 | Neuroscience of Action**

## 1. Overview
**Theory Link:** Affordance Competition Hypothesis (Cisek), Parallel Processing.
**The Hook:** "Your brain doesn't decide *then* act. It prepares *everything* and lets the world decide."
**Format:** Tabletop Simulation.

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
1.  **Visualize** neural activity as parallel preparation of multiple plans.
2.  **Demonstrate** how "Decision Making" is actually "Action Selection" through inhibition.
3.  **Explain** the "Urgency" signal (why we guess when time runs out).

## 3. Preparation
**Materials:**
*   **Poker Chips** (Red and Blue) or Post-it Notes.
*   **Target Object** (A cup).
*   **Table Mat:** Mark two zones: "Reach Left (Red)" and "Reach Right (Blue)."

## 4. The Protocol (Seminar Mode)

### Phase 1: The Setup (10 mins)
1.  **Roles:**
    *   Student A: **Visual Cortex** (Reports where the cup is).
    *   Student B & C: **Red Population** (Reach Left).
    *   Student D & E: **Blue Population** (Reach Right).
2.  **Rule:** The more evidence you have, the more chips you pile in your zone.

### Phase 2: The Race (20 mins)
1.  **Trial 1: Ambiguity.**
    *   Instructor places cup exactly in the middle.
    *   *Action:* Both populations pile chips equally. "We are both ready!"
2.  **Trial 2: The Bias.**
    *   Instructor nudges cup slightly Left.
    *   *Action:* Red pile grows faster. Blue pile grows slower (but doesn't stop).
3.  **Trial 3: The Go Signal.**
    *   Instructor shouts "GO LEFT!"
    *   *Action:* Red pile spikes. Blue pile gets swept away (Mutual Inhibition).

### Phase 3: Urgency (15 mins)
1.  **Scenario:** "You have 1 second."
2.  **Action:** Both piles must grow FAST even with no evidence.
3.  **Result:** The slightest noise triggers a false start. (This explains false starts in sprinting).

## 5. Debrief Questions
1.  "How is this different from the 'Computer' model (Input -> Process -> Output)?" (Answer: Input and Output happen *at the same time*).
2.  "Why is it useful to prepare an action you don't take?" (Speed).

## 6. Artifact of the Week Connection
*   Ask about "faking out" opponents in sports, or hesitation moments.
