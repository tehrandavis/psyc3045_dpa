# Activity Guide: Visualizing Tau
**Week 2 | The Geometry of Looming**

## 1. Overview
**Theory Link:** Direct Perception, Ecological Optics, Time-to-Contact.
**The Hook:** "How do you know when to brake? You don't know your speed (meters/sec) or the distance (meters). Your brain doesn't have a speedometer."
**Format:** Video Analysis & Prediction Game.

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
1.  **Identify** the optical variable $\tau$ (Tau) as distinct from physical distance or speed.
2.  **Experience** the precision of their own visual system in detecting time-to-contact.
3.  **Calculate** Tau conceptually ($\tau = A / \dot{A}$)—Current Size divided by Rate of Expansion.

## 3. Preparation
**Materials:**
*   Projector/Screen.
*   **Video Clips:**
    *   POV of a car driving into a wall/cone (search "Looming effect video" or "Optic flow expansion").
    *   A ball being thrown directly at the camera.
*   Stopwatch App (on your phone).

**Instructor Mental Prep:**
*   Review Lee (1976). Remember the core argument: We don't perceive $D$ (distance), we perceive $D/V$ (time) directly.

## 4. The Protocol (Seminar Mode)

### Phase 1: The Prediction Game (15 mins)
1.  **Setup:** "I'm going to show you a video of an object hitting the camera. I will pause it before it hits."
2.  **Trial 1:** Play video. Pause 2.0 seconds before impact.
    *   *Task:* "Close your eyes. Clap when you think it would have hit you."
    *   *Measure:* Use stopwatch to see how close the group's "Clap" was to 2.0s.
3.  **Trial 2:** Pause 4.0 seconds before impact. (Harder).
4.  **Trial 3:** Use a different speed video.

### Phase 2: The Math of Expansion (20 mins)
1.  **The Mystery:** "You all clapped within 200ms of the actual impact. How? You don't know the speed of the car. You don't know the lens focal length."
2.  **Whiteboard:** Draw the "Optic Array."
    *   Draw an eye and an approaching square.
    *   Show that as distance decreases, the angle ($\theta$) on the retina expands.
3.  **The Formula:** Write $\tau = \theta / \dot{\theta}$ (Angle / Rate of Expansion).
    *   *Key Insight:* "This variable is available *in the light*. You don't need to know distance."

### Phase 3: Violating the Law (15 mins)
1.  **Discussion:** "When does Tau fail?"
    *   *Scenario:* A small object moving slowly vs. a large object moving fast.
    *   *Scenario:* "The Size-Arrival Effect" (Why we misjudge trains vs. cars).
    *   *Scenario:* Braking behind a truck vs. a motorcycle.

## 5. Debrief Questions
1.  "If Tau specifies time-to-contact, why do drivers get into rear-end collisions?" (Distraction? Or is Tau only effective at close range?)
2.  "How does this prove Gibson's point about 'Direct Perception'?" (No calculation of distance needed).

## 6. Artifact of the Week Connection
*   Ask about artifacts related to driving, sports collisions, or "flinching" reactions.
