# Activity Guide: The Finger Wiggling Phase Transition
**Week 6 | The HKB Model Lab**

## 1. Overview
**Theory Link:** The HKB Model, Phase Transitions, Self-Organization.
**The Hook:** "I can force your body to switch patterns, and you can't stop it. Your stability is governed by math, not choice."
**Format:** Formal Lab Experiment (N=1 Design).

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
1.  **Experience** a non-linear phase transition (involuntary switch from anti-phase to in-phase).
2.  **Collect** high-fidelity psychophysical data on their own stability limits.
3.  **Explain** "Critical Fluctuations" (variability increases just before the switch).

## 3. Preparation
**Materials:**
*   Metronome App (connected to speakers - needs to be loud/clear).
*   Data Sheets (Columns: Trial #, Start BPM, Switch BPM).
*   *Optional:* Video camera (phone) to record the fingers for slow-motion replay.

**Instructor Mental Prep:**
*   **Anti-Phase:** Index fingers move in same direction (Left/Left). Hard at high speeds.
*   **In-Phase:** Index fingers move toward center/away from center (Mirror). Stable at high speeds.
*   **The HKB Prediction:** As frequency (Control Parameter) increases, Anti-Phase destabilizes and the system falls into In-Phase.

## 4. The Protocol (Seminar Mode)

### Phase 1: Training (10 mins)
1.  **Practice Anti-Phase:** "Wag fingers like windshield wipers (Left, Right, Left, Right)."
2.  **Practice In-Phase:** "Wag fingers together/apart (Pinch, Open, Pinch, Open)."
3.  **The Rule:** "You must *try* to keep doing Anti-Phase. Do not switch on purpose. But if you switch, let it happen. Do not stop."

### Phase 2: Data Collection (30 mins)
1.  **Trial 1:**
    *   Start Metronome at 120 BPM (2 Hz).
    *   Increase by 10 BPM every 5 seconds.
    *   **Task:** Students shout "SWITCH" when they lose the pattern.
    *   **Record:** The BPM at the switch.
2.  **Trials 2-5:** Repeat.
    *   *Goal:* Get a robust mean for each student.

### Phase 3: Analysis (20 mins)
1.  **Calculate Personal Means:**
    *   Student A Mean: 180 BPM.
    *   Student B Mean: 210 BPM.
2.  **Discussion:** "Why is Student B more stable? (Intrinsic dynamics, musicianship, gaming experience?)."
3.  **Hysteresis Check:** (If time permits) Try slowing down from 240 BPM. Do they switch *back* to Anti-Phase? (Answer: No, or very late. In-Phase is too stable).

## 5. Debrief Questions
1.  "Did you 'decide' to switch? Or did it just happen?" (Loss of stability vs. Motor Program).
2.  "How is this like a horse switching from trot to gallop?"
3.  "Why does variability increase right before the switch?" (Critical fluctuations - the ball shaking in the shallow valley).

## 6. Artifact of the Week Connection
*   Ask about sudden changes in nature (water freezing, avalanches) or behavior (snapping under pressure).
