# Activity Guide: The Council of Science
**Week 11 | The Great Debate (Roleplay)**

## 1. Overview
**Theory Link:** Ecological Psychology vs. Predictive Processing vs. Enactivism.
**The Hook:** "Science isn't a textbook; it's a fight between egos and worldviews. Pick a side."
**Format:** Roleplay Roundtable.

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
1.  **Articulate** the core axioms of Gibsonian vs. Predictive Processing frameworks.
2.  **Synthesize** course concepts (Tau, HKB, Affordances) to defend a theoretical position.
3.  **Evaluate** the strengths and weaknesses of each view.

## 3. Preparation
**Materials:**
*   Name Placards (Folded paper):
    *   **James Gibson** (The Purist).
    *   **Andy Clark** (The Bayesian).
    *   **Esther Thelen** (The Dynamist).
    *   **The Skeptic** (You/Student).
    *   **The Pragmatist** (Student).

**Instructor Mental Prep:**
*   **Gibson:** "Direct perception! No inference! Information is in the light!"
*   **Clark:** "The brain is a prediction machine! We minimize error! The light is noisy!"
*   **Thelen:** "It's not in the brain OR the light! It emerges from the body/task!"

## 4. The Protocol (Seminar Mode)

### Phase 1: Character Assignment (10 mins)
1.  Assign roles. Give them 5 mins to "get in character."
    *   *Tip:* Tell Gibson to be grumpy. Tell Clark to be enthusiastic about robots.

### Phase 2: The Tribunal (30 mins)
1.  **Case 1: The Stair Lab.**
    *   **Skeptic:** "We walked up stairs. Explain it."
    *   **Gibson:** "The ratio $R/L$ was specified in the optic array. I just detected it."
    *   **Clark:** "Nonsense! My brain had a 'Stair Model' and predicted the step height. I minimized surprise."
    *   **Thelen:** "The leg stiffness emerged from the dynamics of the climb!"
2.  **Case 2: The Hollow Face Illusion.** (Clark loves illusions; Gibson hates them).
    *   Let them fight.

### Phase 3: The Verdict (15 mins)
1.  **Break Character.**
2.  **Discussion:** "Who won Case 1? Who won Case 2?"
3.  **Synthesis:** "Can we have both? (e.g., Cisek's Affordance Competition)."

## 5. Debrief Questions
1.  "Why does Predictive Processing struggle with the 'Homunculus' problem?"
2.  "Why does Gibson struggle with illusions?"

## 6. Artifact of the Week Connection
*   Ask about illusions, magic tricks (prediction error), or "unconscious" skills.
