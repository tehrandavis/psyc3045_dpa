# Activity Guide: The Frozen Limb Challenge
**Week 7 | Degrees of Freedom & Synergies**

## 1. Overview
**Theory Link:** The Bernstein Problem, Degrees of Freedom (DOF), Freezing vs. Freeing.
**The Hook:** "Why do beginners look stiff? Because they are solving a math problem by deleting variables."
**Format:** Motor Learning Game.

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
1.  **Experience** the "Bernstein Problem" (too many joints to control).
2.  **Demonstrate** "Freezing" as a novice strategy to reduce DOFs.
3.  **Demonstrate** "Freeing/Synergy" as an expert strategy to exploit reactive forces.

## 3. Preparation
**Materials:**
*   Tennis balls or Bean Bags (10-15).
*   A Target (Bucket, Trash can, or Hula hoop).
*   Video Camera (Phone) on a tripod/stand.

## 4. The Protocol (Seminar Mode)

### Phase 1: The Novice Simulation (20 mins)
1.  **The Constraint:** "You are a novice. You cannot handle complex interactions."
2.  **Rule:** "Keep your wrist and elbow RIGID. Like a cast. You can only rotate your shoulder."
3.  **Task:** Throw the ball into the bucket from 15 feet away.
    *   *Experience:* It feels robotic, awkward, and requires high force.
    *   *Observation:* Record a video. Look for the "blocky" movement.

### Phase 2: The Expert Release (20 mins)
1.  **The Release:** "Now, unfreeze the elbow. Use a whip-like motion."
2.  **Task:** Throw again.
3.  **Analysis:** "Notice how the elbow extends *passively* due to the shoulder's rotation? That's reactive force. You didn't 'command' the elbow; you allowed physics to move it."
4.  **Full Synergy:** "Now use the wrist too. Use the legs."

### Phase 3: The Synergy Discussion (20 mins)
1.  **Review Video:** Watch the novice vs. expert clips side-by-side.
2.  **Concept:** "A Synergy is a functional grouping. Your shoulder, elbow, and wrist became a single unit."
3.  **Context-Conditioned Variability:** "If I bump your elbow while you throw, your wrist automatically compensates. That's a synergy."

## 5. Debrief Questions
1.  "Why is 'keep your eye on the ball' bad advice for a novice?" (Because their problem is their *body*, not the ball).
2.  "How does this explain rehabilitation? (Stroke patients often freeze limbs to regain control)."

## 6. Artifact of the Week Connection
*   Ask about videos of babies learning to walk (stiff legs) or robots moving (often too rigid).
