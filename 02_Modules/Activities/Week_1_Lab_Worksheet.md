## 1. Field Notes
*What is one thing you noticed this week—in your daily life—that relates to perception or action?*
(e.g., A moment where you "saw" something that wasn't there, a clumsy movement, a reflex...)

## Part 1: The Outness Problem & Local Causality

**Activity: The Cane Demo**
1.  When you tap the floor/object with the cane, **where** do you feel the contact?
    *   [ ] In my hand
    *   [ ] At the tip of the cane

2.  **Where** are the nerve endings detecting the pressure?
    *   [ ] In my hand
    *   [ ] At the tip of the cane

3.  **The Paradox:** If stimulation is local (at the hand), how is experience distal (at the tip)?
    <br>
    <br>

**Activity: The Teleporting Chair**
*   With your eyes closed, how do you **know** the chair exists *right now*? (Constraint: You cannot use memory of the past).
    <br>
    <br>

## Part 2: The Poverty of the Stimulus

**Activity: The Hand Demo**
1.  Hold your hand at arm's length. Bring it 6 inches from your face.
2.  The image on your retina just **quadrupled** in size.
3.  Why didn't you perceive your hand growing?

4.  **The Challenge:** Write the "rule" your brain used to solve this (The "Size Constancy" Rule).
    *   *Rule:* "If retinal size increases, BUT distance _______________, THEN object size is constant."
    *   *Problem:* How does your brain know the distance? (Hint: The retinal image is 2D).

**The Beuchet Chair**
*   What specific conditions are required for the illusion to work?
    <br>
*   What single action breaks the illusion?
    <br>

## Part 3: Unconscious Inference

**Activity: Be the Central Executive**
1.  Look at the ambiguous image (Duck/Rabbit).
2.  What did you see first? ___________________
3.  **The Infinite Regress:**
    *   What rule determined that answer? ______________________________________
    *   What rule told you to apply *that* rule? __________________________________
    *   Who interprets the interpreter? _________________________________________

## Part 4: Processing Time

**The Fastball Problem**
*   Time for ball to reach plate (90mph): **~400ms**
*   Your Processing Time:
    *   Retina to Cortex: ~50ms
    *   Interpretation/Decision: ~100ms
    *   Motor Planning/Execution: ~100ms
    *   **Total:** ___________ ms

*   **The Question:** If perception takes time, are you seeing the ball where it *is* (now), or where it *was* (in the past)?

**Activity: The Ball Toss**
*   Did you catch it? [ ] Yes [ ] No
*   If the "Traditional Story" (Calculation + Prediction) is true, was this catch possible? Why/Why not?
    <br>

## Summary: The Chain of Assumptions

*Trace the logical trap. If you accept the first assumption, do the others inevitably follow?*

1.  **Local Causality** (A must touch B to cause B)
    ↓ implies...
2.  We need a **Mediator** (The Copy/Retinal Image)
    ↓ but...
3.  The Copy is **Bad/Ambiguous** (Poverty of Stimulus)
    ↓ therefore...
4.  We must **Fix** the copy (Unconscious Inference)
    ↓ requires...
5.  A **Central Executive** (The Homunculus)
    ↓ takes...
6.  **Processing Time** (Delay)
    ↓ result...
7.  **We are trapped in the past, inside our heads.**

## The Ecological Alternative (Preview)

*What if we reject Assumption #1 (Local Causality)?*

If we don't need a **Copy**, we don't need **Inference**, and we don't need a **Homunculus**.

**Reading for Tuesday:** Blau & Wagman, Chapters 1-2.
*Look for: How do they propose we break this chain?*
