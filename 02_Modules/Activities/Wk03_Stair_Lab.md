# Activity Guide: The Great Stair Lab
**Week 3 | Deep Data Field Trip**

## 1. Overview
**Theory Link:** Affordances, Body-Scaling, Dimensionless Numbers ($\pi$). 
**The Hook:** "Why are some stairs annoying and others invisible? It's not about the stairs; it's about your legs." 
**Format:** Field Data Collection (N=1 Focus).

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
1.  **Define** an affordance as a ratio between environment ($R$) and animal ($L$).
2.  **Calculate** their intrinsic $\pi$ number for stair climbing.
3.  **Evaluate** Warren's (1984) prediction that optimal climbing occurs at $R/L = 0.26$.

## 3. Preparation
**Materials:**
*   Tape Measures (one per student - bring 5).
*   Notebooks/Pens.
*   **Route Map:** Identify 3-4 staircases nearby:
    *   *Standard:* (e.g., Library main stairs).
    *   *Shallow:* (e.g., Outdoor plaza steps).
    *   *Steep:* (e.g., Back maintenance stairs or "The Steep Steps").
    *   *Ramp:* (Optional contrast).

## 4. The Protocol (Seminar Mode)

### Phase 1: The Briefing (10 mins)
1.  **Concept:** Explain "Body Scaling." A 6ft person and a 5ft person live in different worlds.
2.  **The Hypothesis:** "Warren claims the perfect stair is always $0.26 \times$ your leg length. Let's test it."
3.  **Measurement 1:** Have students pair up and measure each other's Leg Length ($L$).
    *   *Method:* Floor to hip joint (greater trochanter).

### Phase 2: The Safari (30 mins)
1.  **Walk to Staircase A (Standard):**
    *   Measure Riser Height ($R$).
    *   Everyone climbs it up/down 3 times.
    *   **Rate:** Comfort (1-10) and Effort (1-10).
2.  **Walk to Staircase B (Shallow/Outdoor):** Repeat.
3.  **Walk to Staircase C (Steep):** Repeat.

### Phase 3: The "Lab Meeting" (20 mins)
1.  **Return to Class.**
2.  **The Big Board:** Draw a graph.
    *   X-Axis: Intrinsic Ratio ($R/L$).
    *   Y-Axis: Comfort Rating.
3.  **Plotting:** Have each student plot their 3 data points in a different color.
4.  **Analysis:**
    *   "Look at Student A (Tall) vs. Student B (Short) on the 'Steep' stairs."
    *   *Insight:* Student B might rate the steep stairs as "Impossible" ($R/L > 0.88$), while Student A rates them as "Hard but doable."
    *   **The Critical Number:** Do the peaks cluster around 0.26?

## 5. Debrief Questions
1.  "If we built a house for a giant, how big should the stairs be?"
2.  "Is 'climbability' a property of the stairs? Or a property of the person?" (Answer: Neither. It's the relation).
3.  "How does this change how you see 'Disability'?" (A mismatch of $R/L$, not a defect in the person).

## 6. Artifact of the Week Connection
*   Look for artifacts related to "bad design," uncomfortable furniture, or accessibility fails.
