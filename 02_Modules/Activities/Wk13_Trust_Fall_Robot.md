# Activity Guide: Trust Fall with a Robot
**Week 13 | Human-Machine Teaming**

## 1. Overview
**Theory Link:** Ecological Interface Design (EID), Asymmetric Coordination, Trust.
**The Hook:** "Would you sleep in a self-driving car? What information would you need to close your eyes?"
**Format:** Design Scenario / Sketching.

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
1.  **Apply** EID principles to a novel design problem.
2.  **Distinguish** between "Symbolic Displays" (warnings) and "Ambient Displays" (feel).
3.  **Define** Trust as a stability parameter in the HKB model.

## 3. Preparation
**Materials:**
*   Paper/Sketchpads.
*   Markers.
*   *Optional:* Video of Tesla Autopilot warnings ("Beep beep! Take control!").

## 4. The Protocol (Seminar Mode)

### Phase 1: The Problem (10 mins)
1.  **Scenario:** "Level 5 Autonomous Car. You are the passenger. You want to nap."
2.  **The Issue:** "Current cars beep when they are confused. This wakes you up. How can the car communicate 'I got this' vs 'I'm unsure' *without* language?"

### Phase 2: The Design Charrette (30 mins)
1.  **Brainstorm:** "What perceptual variables specify 'Stability'?" (e.g., Heartbeat, Rhythmic vibration, Smooth lighting).
2.  **Sketching:** Each student designs a dashboard or haptic seat.
    *   *Idea A:* The seat "breathes" (inflates/deflates) with the car's confidence level.
    *   *Idea B:* Ambient blue light that turns jagged when uncertainty rises.
3.  **Critique:** "Does this require *processing* (reading)? Or is it direct perception?"

### Phase 3: The Pitch (20 mins)
1.  Each student pitches their design to the group.
2.  **Vote:** Which car would you trust with your life?

## 5. Debrief Questions
1.  "Why is a 'Beep' a bad alarm?" (It's binary. It implies total failure).
2.  "How do humans signal trust? (Relaxed muscles, gaze). Can robots mimic this?"

## 6. Artifact of the Week Connection
*   Ask about interactions with Chatbots, GPS, or "smart" devices that felt dumb.
