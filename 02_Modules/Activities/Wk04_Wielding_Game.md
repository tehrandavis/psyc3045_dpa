# Activity Guide: The Wielding Game
**Week 4 | Dynamic Touch & The Inertia Tensor**

## 1. Overview
**Theory Link:** Dynamic Touch, Haptics, The Inertia Tensor.
**The Hook:** "You don't feel weight. You feel how hard it is to *wiggle* something."
**Format:** Blindfolded Perception Experiment.

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
1.  **Distinguish** between Cutaneous Touch (skin) and Dynamic Touch (muscles/joints).
2.  **Demonstrate** that perceived length is driven by Rotational Inertia ($I$), not mass ($m$).
3.  **Experience** the "Inertia Tensor" (the feeling of an object's resistance to rotation in 3D).

## 3. Preparation
**Materials:**
*   **The "Tensor Rods":**
    *   A wooden dowel or PVC pipe (approx 1m long).
    *   A weight (e.g., a heavy washer or taped bag of sand) that can slide up and down the rod.
    *   Tape to secure the weight.
*   Blindfolds (or honor system).
*   Whiteboard with a horizontal line drawn on it (the "Scale").

**Instructor Mental Prep:**
*   Remember the physics: $I = m r^2$. Moving the weight $2	imes$ further out makes it $4	imes$ harder to rotate. This "resistance to rotation" is what the brain uses to perceive length.

## 4. The Protocol (Seminar Mode)

### Phase 1: The Setup (10 mins)
1.  **Blindfold Student A.**
2.  **Posture:** Student A holds the rod by the handle, arm hanging down, using *only the wrist* to wiggle it.
3.  **The Question:** "How long is this rod? Point to where the tip is."

### Phase 2: The Manipulation (20 mins)
1.  **Condition 1 (Base):** Weight is near the hand.
    *   Student A estimates length. Mark it on the board.
2.  **Condition 2 (Illusion):** *Secretly* move the weight to the very tip of the rod.
    *   Student A wiggles it again.
    *   *Prediction:* They will perceive the rod as **much longer** (or heavier/massive), even though physical length is identical.
3.  **Condition 3 (The Trick):** Add a second weight near the hand (increasing mass $m$ but not much $I$).
    *   *Result:* "It feels heavier, but not necessarily longer."

### Phase 3: The Reveal (15 mins)
1.  Remove blindfolds. Show them the rod.
2.  **Discussion:** "Why did you think the rod grew 2 feet?"
3.  **The Math:** Explain $I 
ope L^2$. The brain assumes a uniform density rod. If $I$ goes up, the brain infers $L$ went up.
4.  **Applications:** Tennis rackets, hammers, baseball bats. "Choking up" on a bat reduces $I$, making it feel "shorter" and faster to swing.

## 5. Debrief Questions
1.  "Is touch about the skin? Or is it about the exploratory act (wiggling)?"
2.  "How does this relate to using a tool (like a cane or a pencil)? Do you feel the cane, or do you feel the ground *at the end* of the cane?" (Distal attribution).

## 6. Artifact of the Week Connection
*   Ask about sports equipment, tools, or "extensions of the body" (e.g., using a stick to poke a fire).
