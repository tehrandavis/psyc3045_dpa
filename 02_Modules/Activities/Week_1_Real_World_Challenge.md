# Week 1 "In the field": Breaking the "Standard Story"

**Name:** ___________________________

**The Mission:**
Find one specific, everyday activity where the "Computer Metaphor" seems to bump into problems. Where does the logic break down?

---

### 1. The Activity
*Describe a fast, dynamic, or complex task you performed or observed today (e.g., driving in traffic, walking down stairs, catching a set of keys, navigating a crowded hallway).*

**Task:** _________________________________________________________________________

---

### 2. The "Computer" Attempt
*Imagine you have to program a robot to do this using the Traditional Assumptions. What "Math" does it need to do?*

*   **The Input (The Camera):** What raw data does it get? (e.g., 2D flat image, light intensity, pressure on a sensor).
    <br>
    <br>
*   **The Calculation (The Processor):** What variables must it calculate *before* it can act? (e.g., Velocity? Distance? Gravity? Future position? Friction?).
    <br>
    <br>

### 3. The Stress Test
*Why does this model fail for this specific task? Pick **ONE** trap and apply it.*

**[ ] Trap A: The Speed Limit (Processing Time)**
*   How fast does the event happen? ______________
*   If perception takes ~200ms, where would you be by the time you finished calculating? (e.g., "I would have already crashed," "The ball would have hit my face").
    <br>

**[ ] Trap B: The Ambiguity (Poverty of Stimulus)**
*   Is the static input ambiguous? (e.g., "A small car close up looks the same as a big car far away").
*   Does the robot need to "guess" or "infer" what is real? How could it guess wrong?
    <br>

**[ ] Trap C: The Homunculus (Infinite Regress)**
*   Does the robot need a "rule" to interpret the input? (e.g., "If dark patch, then hole").
*   How does it know *that* rule applies here? (e.g., "What if it's just a shadow?").
    <br>

### 4. The Ecological Hint
*If you didn't compute, predict, or infer... what **did** you do?*
*(Don't worry about the scientific term yet—just describe the experience. Did you "calculate" the stairs, or did you just step?)*
