# Activity Guide: The Unintentional Sync
**Week 9 | Social Coordination Dynamics**

## 1. Overview
**Theory Link:** Interpersonal Synergies, Entrainment, Coupling Strength.
**The Hook:** "You think you walk alone. But if I walk next to you, we become a single system."
**Format:** Dyad Lab (Instructor Participates).

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
1.  **Observe** spontaneous entrainment (synchronization) in social contexts.
2.  **Manipulate** "Coupling Strength" via visual information.
3.  **Explain** why coordination is an emergent property, not a social agreement.

## 3. Preparation
**Materials:**
*   Rocking Chairs (ideal) OR Side-by-side walking path (hallway).
*   Metronome App (for measuring tempo, not setting it).
*   Stopwatch.

**Instructor Mental Prep:**
*   You will need to partner with the "odd" student (N=5).
*   **The Trick:** You can subtly "drive" the system. If you stare at their feet, you increase visual coupling. If you look away, you break it.

## 4. The Protocol (Seminar Mode)

### Phase 1: Baseline (Independent) (15 mins)
1.  **Task:** "Walk down the hallway at your natural, comfortable pace."
2.  **Measure:** Count steps for 30 seconds. Calculate Natural Tempo ($f_1$ and $f_2$).
    *   *Note:* Student A might be 1.8 Hz, Student B might be 2.0 Hz. They are detuned.

### Phase 2: Weak Coupling (15 mins)
1.  **Task:** "Walk side-by-side. Do NOT look at each other. Look straight ahead. Do not talk."
2.  **Measure:** Check for phase locking. Do footsteps sound like "Clop-Clop" (out of phase) or "Boom" (in phase)?
3.  **Result:** Weak entrainment might happen mechanically or peripherally.

### Phase 3: Strong Coupling (15 mins)
1.  **Task:** "Walk side-by-side. Talk to each other. Look at each other."
2.  **Observation:** "Notice how the footsteps synchronize perfectly."
3.  **The Instructor Manipulation:** (For your dyad)
    *   Start out of sync.
    *   Suddenly look intently at the student while talking.
    *   *Watch:* They will likely pull into your rhythm.

## 5. Debrief Questions
1.  "Did you *try* to match steps? (Usually 'No')."
2.  "Why does visual information (seeing them sway) act like a mechanical spring connecting us?"
3.  "How does this relate to 'Rapport'? (Social connection is literally physical sync)."

## 6. Artifact of the Week Connection
*   Ask about audiences clapping, soldiers marching, or "awkward walking" when trying to pass someone.
