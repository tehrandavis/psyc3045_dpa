# Activity Guide: Tech Affordance Audit
**Week 10 | The Landscape of Affordances**

## 1. Overview
**Theory Link:** Skilled Intentionality, Solicitations, Arresting Affordances (Rietveld).
**The Hook:** "Your phone isn't a neutral tool. It is an aggressive landscape of 'Click Me' buttons designed to arrest your attention."
**Format:** Design Critique / UX Analysis.

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
1.  **Identify** "Solicitations" in UI design (what invites action).
2.  **Analyze** the "Field of Affordances" (relevant vs. irrelevant options).
3.  **Critique** "Dark Patterns" (infinite scroll) as "Arresting Affordances" (hard to stop).

## 3. Preparation
**Materials:**
*   Students' Smartphones.
*   Whiteboard (to map the landscape).

## 4. The Protocol (Seminar Mode)

### Phase 1: The Audit (20 mins)
1.  **Open an App:** Everyone open TikTok, Instagram, or a Mobile Game.
2.  **Task 1 - Solicitations:** "Freeze! Look at the screen. What is 'shouting' at you to act?"
    *   *Examples:* Red notification dots, pulsing buttons, moving videos.
3.  **Task 2 - Friction:** "Try to leave. How many clicks does it take to log out or close it?"
    *   *Concept:* Friction is the removal of affordances.

### Phase 2: Mapping the Field (20 mins)
1.  **Scenario:** "You are bored."
    *   *Map:* The "Scroll" affordance is highly salient.
2.  **Scenario:** "You are late for class."
    *   *Map:* The "Scroll" affordance should recede. Does it? Or does the app try to keep it relevant?
3.  **Discussion:** "A 'Tool' (Hammer) waits for you to use it. A 'Tech' (TikTok) demands you use it. Is it still an affordance?"

### Phase 3: Redesign (20 mins)
1.  **Challenge:** "Redesign the notification center to be 'Ecologically Safe'."
2.  **Idea:** Only show affordances when relevant to the *user's* action plan, not the *company's* profit plan.

## 5. Debrief Questions
1.  "Rietveld says we are 'responsive to the relevant affordances.' How do apps hack relevance?"
2.  "Is Infinite Scroll a 'Repeller' of stopping?"

## 6. Artifact of the Week Connection
*   Ask about annoying notifications, "sticky" apps, or "calm technology."
