# Activity Guide: Mapping Your Attractors
**Week 5 | Dynamical Systems Visualization**

## 1. Overview
**Theory Link:** Dynamical Systems, Potential Landscapes, Stability.
**The Hook:** "Why is it so hard to break a bad habit? Because it's a deep valley in your potential landscape."
**Format:** Personal Reflection & Drawing Workshop.

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
1.  **Visualize** behavior using a Potential Landscape ($V$) metaphor (ball and valleys).
2.  **Identify** Attractors (stable states), Repellers (unstable states), and Control Parameters (variables that change the landscape).
3.  **Apply** dynamical terminology to a complex personal behavior.

## 3. Preparation
**Materials:**
*   A3 Paper or large whiteboard space per student.
*   Colored Markers.
*   *Optional:* A physical bowl and a marble (to demonstrate stability).

**Instructor Mental Prep:**
*   Review the terminology:
    *   **Attractor:** Where the system "wants" to go (Deep valley).
    *   **Repeller:** Where the system pushes away from (Hilltop).
    *   **Basin of Attraction:** The set of initial conditions that lead to the attractor.
    *   **Control Parameter:** The knob you turn that reshapes the landscape (e.g., Stress level).

## 4. The Protocol (Seminar Mode)

### Phase 1: The Concept Demo (10 mins)
1.  **The Marble:** Put a marble in a bowl. Shake it. Watch it settle.
    *   "This is a **Point Attractor**. No matter where I start, it goes here."
2.  **The Concept:** "Your behaviors are like this marble. You don't 'decide' to sleep at 2 AM; your system settles there."

### Phase 2: The Workshop (25 mins)
1.  **Task:** "Pick a habit or behavior you want to analyze." (e.g., Sleep schedule, Smartphone usage, Procrastination, Coffee drinking).
2.  **Step 1: Draw the Landscape.**
    *   Draw the X-axis (The state space, e.g., "Time of going to bed").
    *   Draw the curve (Potential $V$).
    *   Make a deep valley where they *currently* are (e.g., 2 AM).
    *   Make a shallow valley where they *want* to be (e.g., 10 PM).
3.  **Step 2: Add the Marble.**
    *   Draw where they are right now.

### Phase 3: The Dynamical Analysis (20 mins)
1.  **Identify the Control Parameter:** "What changes the shape of this landscape?"
    *   *Student Example:* "When I have **Exams** (Control Parameter), the 2 AM valley gets deeper."
    *   *Student Example:* "When I have **Morning Practice**, the 10 PM valley gets deeper."
2.  **Visualize the Bifurcation:** Ask them to draw a second landscape showing how it changes under stress.

## 5. Debrief Questions
1.  "Why doesn't 'willpower' works? (Answer: You're trying to push the marble uphill. You need to change the landscape/control parameter instead)."
2.  "What is a 'Repeller' in your life?" (e.g., That awkward conversation topic you steer away from).

## 6. Artifact of the Week Connection
*   Ask about "ruts" people get into, or sudden behavioral changes (tipping points).
