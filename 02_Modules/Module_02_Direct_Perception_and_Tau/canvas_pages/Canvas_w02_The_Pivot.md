# Module 02 - The Pivot: Starting Over

## Weekly Overview

Last week, we broke the "Computer Metaphor." We discovered that if you assume the brain is an information processor, you end up trapped in a logical infinite regress (the Homunculus) and unable to explain how we catch a fly ball in real time.

**This week, we start over.**

We are pivoting to the **Ecological Approach**. We replace the assumption of "Poverty of the Stimulus" (bad input) with "Richness of the Stimulus" (lawful information). We replace "Linear Causality" with "System Causality." We replace the "Machine" with the "Sunflower."

We will also test this new theory directly. If perception is for action, then our motor system should be smarter than our conscious perception. We will put this to the test in the lab.

**By the end of this week, here's what you should be able to do:**

*   **Define the "Animal-Environment System":** Explain why we cannot define an animal without its niche, and why this unity eliminates the need for a "copy" of the world.
*   **Contrast "Computation" with "Resonance":** Use the **Polar Planimeter** metaphor to explain how a "dumb" instrument can measure complex properties (like Area or Time-to-Contact) directly without calculating them.
*   **Explain "Direct Perception":** Articulate why the Ecological approach rejects the need for mental representations or inference.
*   **Differentiate Vision for Action vs. Perception:** Use the Ebbinghaus Illusion to demonstrate that the eye can be fooled while the hand (often) remains accurate.

## Required Readings 

**1. Blau & Wagman, Chapters 3 & 4 (The New Foundation) DUE NEXT TUESDAY**
*   **The 9 Assumptions:** Chapter 3 lists the new axioms. Pay attention to **Realism**, **Direct Perception**, and **Non-Linear Causality**. How do these solve the "Little Man" problem?
*   **The Polar Planimeter:** Chapter 4 introduces a tool that measures area without measuring length. Why is this the perfect metaphor for a biological perceptual system?
*   **The Orchestra:** What happens when the Conductor (Dr. Pick) gets sick? How does the orchestra keep playing? This is your introduction to **Self-Organization**.

**2. Haffenden et al. (2001) - The Dissociation DUE THURSDAY**
*   **The Mystery:** When people look at the Ebbinghaus illusion (circles surrounded by other circles), they see the size wrong. But when they reach to pick it up, their fingers open to the *correct* size.
*   **The Implication:** If the "mental image" is wrong, but the action is right... what information is the hand using? This supports the idea that **Action** is direct.
