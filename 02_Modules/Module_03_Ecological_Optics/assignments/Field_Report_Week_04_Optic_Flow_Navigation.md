# Optic Flow & Navigation in the Wild

---

## Your assignment

**Find and document ONE real-world example where optic flow, tau (time-to-contact), or visual guidance of navigation is clearly at work.**

This week, you learned that the ambient optic array carries structured information that directly specifies action possibilities—no computation required. Your job is to catch this information "in the act" in everyday life.

## What to Look For

### Category A: Optic Flow Patterns

**Concept:** As you move through the environment, the optic array flows in systematic patterns. Objects approach from the center of expansion, flow past you, and recede behind.

**Where to find it:**

- **Driving/riding:** Film through your windshield or as a passenger. Notice how the road "flows" toward you.
- **Walking down a hallway:** Record your point of view. Notice how the walls, floor tiles, or ceiling panels expand and flow past.
- **Video games:** First-person perspective games (FPS, racing, flight simulators) simulate optic flow. Capture 10 seconds of gameplay.
- **Movies/TV:** POV shots, chase scenes, drone footage through forests. Find a clip that shows rich optic flow.
- **Architecture:** Corridors, staircases, bridges designed to "pull you through" space using visual flow.

**What makes it interesting:** Can you identify the **center of expansion** (where you're heading)? What happens when you turn?

### Category B: Tau (Time-to-Contact) in Action

**Concept:** Tau is the rate of optical expansion. It directly specifies when an object will reach you (or you will reach it)—no distance or velocity calculation needed.

**Where to find it:**

- **Sports:** Baseball outfielders tracking fly balls, goalkeepers saving shots, basketball players catching passes. Find a video where someone **doesn't look away** but continuously tracks the approaching object.
- **Animals:** Birds landing on branches, cats jumping to surfaces, dogs catching frisbees. These are tau experts.
- **Everyday reaches:** Catching your keys, grabbing a door handle, stopping before a wall. Film yourself or a friend performing a quick, accurate reach.
- **Driving:** Braking to a stop at a red light. How does the car in front "loom" as you approach? Film from the driver's perspective (safely!).
- **Escalators/elevators:** Stepping onto a moving surface. Your foot "knows" when to land.

**What makes it interesting:** Does the person/animal **look at the target continuously**? Do they adjust their movement smoothly (not in discrete steps)?

### Category C: Navigation & Collision Avoidance

**Concept:** Visual information guides locomotion. You steer toward gaps, avoid obstacles, and maintain heading using flow patterns.

**Where to find it:**

- **Crowds:** Film people navigating a busy sidewalk, mall, or campus. Notice how they weave without bumping.
- **Cycling/skating:** Point-of-view footage navigating through obstacles. Notice how vision guides steering.
- **Robots/autonomous vehicles:** Find videos of robots or self-driving cars navigating. What visual information are they using?
- **Trail running/hiking:** POV footage on uneven terrain. How does the runner adjust to roots, rocks, slopes?
- **Airport/train station:** People with rolling suitcases navigating toward gates. Notice anticipatory adjustments.

**What makes it interesting:** Can you identify what visual information **specifies** where to go or when to turn?

## What to Submit

### 1. Evidence (Choose ONE format):

**Option A: Video (10-30 seconds)**
- Film your own observation OR find an existing video (YouTube, TikTok, news clip)
- Must clearly show optic flow, tau, or navigation behavior
- If using existing video, provide the link

**Option B: Photo Series (3-5 images)**
- Show a sequence of moments (e.g., person reaching for object across frames)
- OR a single powerful image with annotations

**Option C: Physical Object/Design**
- Bring an object or show a design (architecture, product, interface) that exploits optic flow principles
- Be prepared to demonstrate or show photos

### 2. Brief Description (Submit via Canvas by 8 PM Monday ):

Answer these questions in 3-5 sentences:

1. **What did you observe?** (Describe the situation/video/object)
2. **Which concept does it demonstrate?** (Optic flow, tau, navigation, or multiple?)
3. **What is the key visual information?** (What property of the optic array specifies the action?)
4. **Why is this interesting/surprising/clever?** (What made you notice it?)

**Example:**

> I filmed my cat jumping from the floor to the kitchen counter (25 cm height). She crouches, watches the edge continuously, and launches with perfect timing—never looking away. This demonstrates **tau**: the rate of expansion of the counter edge in her visual field directly specifies when to jump. What's surprising: she doesn't "aim and fire"—her gaze stays locked on the landing spot throughout the movement, suggesting continuous visual guidance, not ballistic planning.

## Inspiration & Resources

**Good YouTube search terms:**
- "POV walking/running/cycling"
- "Baseball outfielder catch"
- "Bird landing slow motion"
- "First-person parkour"
- "Autonomous vehicle navigation"
- "Drone racing FPV"

**Campus opportunities:**
- Walk across campus and film your perspective
- Watch how people navigate the student union or library
- Observe athletes at rec center (basketball passes, climbing wall)
- Film yourself going down stairs (notice the flow of steps)

**Don't overthink it:** The world is FULL of optic flow and tau. You encounter it every time you walk, drive, or catch something. Your job is to **notice and capture it**.
