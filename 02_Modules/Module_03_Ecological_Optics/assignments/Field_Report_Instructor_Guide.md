# Field Report: Instructor Facilitation Guide

**Activity:** Week 4 - Optic Flow & Navigation Field Reports
**Duration:** 15-20 minutes (opening segment of Tuesday seminar)
**Format:** Student-led presentations with instructor facilitation

---

## Purpose

Field reports serve three pedagogical functions:

1. **Transfer:** Students apply abstract concepts (optic flow, tau) to concrete, observable phenomena
2. **Engagement:** Starting with student observations creates investment in the day's theoretical discussion
3. **Ecological Validity:** Demonstrates that these aren't "lab curiosities"—they're everywhere

---

## Pre-Class Preparation

### Review Submissions (Monday evening):

Read through Canvas submissions and:

1. **Select 4-5 presentations** to feature in class (aim for diversity):
   - At least one from each category (Flow, Tau, Navigation)
   - Mix of video, photo, and physical examples
   - Range of quality (not just the "best"—interesting errors can be pedagogically rich)

2. **Identify teaching moments:**
   - Common misconceptions (e.g., confusing tau with "aiming")
   - Particularly clever observations
   - Connections across multiple student examples

3. **Prepare follow-up questions** for each selected example (see below)

## In-Class Structure (15-20 min)

### Opening Frame (2 min)

**Say:**
> "Before we dive into the theory today, I want to hear what you saw in the wild this week. Your job was to find optic flow, tau, or navigation in action. Let's see what you discovered."

**Set expectations:**
- "We'll see 4-5 examples today. I picked a range to highlight different aspects."
- "After each presentation, I'll ask clarifying questions, and I want you to help me analyze what visual information is at work."

---

### Presentation Protocol (3 min per example × 4-5 = 12-15 min)

**For each student presentation:**

#### 1. Student Shows Evidence (45 sec)
- Play video, show photos, or demonstrate object
- Student gives their 1-2 minute description

#### 2. Class Observation (30 sec)
**Ask the class:**
- "What did you notice?"
- "What specifically in the visual information tells you [when to brake / where to steer / when to catch]?"

#### 3. Instructor Facilitation (90 sec)
**Use targeted questions to deepen analysis:**

**For Optic Flow examples:**
- "Where is the center of expansion? Point to it."
- "What happens to the flow pattern when they turn?"
- "How does this differ from a static image? What does the flow *tell* you that a snapshot doesn't?"

**For Tau examples:**
- "Is the person/animal watching the target continuously or looking away?"
- "What is expanding in their visual field? The object itself, or the gap around it?"
- "Does this require knowing distance or velocity? Or just tracking the expansion rate?"

**For Navigation examples:**
- "What information specifies 'safe to go' vs. 'collision ahead'?"
- "Are they reacting to obstacles or anticipating them? How can you tell?"
- "Could they do this with their eyes closed? Why or why not?"

#### 4. Bridge to Theory (15 sec)
Connect the observation to the day's reading:
- "This is exactly what Blau & Wagman call [X]—we'll formalize this in the discussion."
- "Hold onto this example—we'll return to it when we talk about [concept]."

## Example Facilitation Sequences

### Example 1: Student shows POV video walking down a hallway

**Student:** "I filmed myself walking to class. You can see the tiles on the floor flowing toward me."

**Class:** "The tiles get bigger and move faster as they get closer!"

**Instructor follow-up:**
- "Great. Now, where is the center of expansion? If I pause the video, can you point to where the flow is radiating from?"
- [Student points to center of frame, where they're heading]
- "Exactly. That point—the center of expansion—directly specifies your heading. If it drifts left, what does that mean?"
- [Student: "I'm turning right?"]
- "Close—it means your heading is drifting right, so you might turn left to correct. This is how you steer without a GPS. The flow pattern tells you where you're going."

**Bridge:** "This is what Gibson called the 'global optic flow field'—we'll see how it guides locomotion in today's reading."

### Example 2: Student shows slow-motion video of a dog catching a frisbee

**Student:** "My dog tracks the frisbee the whole time and catches it perfectly. I think this is tau."

**Class:** "The dog never looks away!"

**Instructor follow-up:**
- "Good observation. Why does that matter? Why is it important that the dog keeps watching?"
- [Student: "So it knows where the frisbee is?"]
- "Deeper than that. The dog isn't just 'checking the location'—it's continuously picking up tau. The frisbee is expanding in the dog's visual field. That expansion rate directly tells the dog when it will arrive. If the dog looked away, it would lose that information."
- "Here's the key: The dog doesn't need to know the frisbee's distance or speed—just the rate of expansion. That's why tau is so powerful. It's a time-to-contact variable, not a spatial one."

**Bridge:** "This is Lee's tau hypothesis—we'll see how it applies to human actions like braking and catching in today's discussion."

### Example 3: Student brings a photo of a curved hallway with perspective lines

**Student:** "I noticed this hallway has these strong lines that seem to pull you toward the exit."

**Class:** [Quiet—unsure what to say]

**Instructor follow-up:**
- "This is a design example, which is great. But let's think about it ecologically. Does this *static* image create optic flow?"
- [Student: "No... but it looks like it would if you walked through it?"]
- "Exactly. The design *simulates* flow structure. Architects and designers use perspective to make spaces feel dynamic. But here's a question: If you stood still in this hallway, would you get optic flow?"
- [Student: "No, you'd have to move."]
- "Right. Flow requires motion—either you moving through the world, or the world moving past you. This is a clever design, but it's not the same as the actual flow information you'd pick up while walking. Anyone see actual optic flow this week while moving?"

**Bridge:** "This highlights an important point: Optic flow is dynamic. It's about change over time. We'll see why that matters when we discuss the difference between 'ambient' and 'radiant' light."

## Common Student Misconceptions & How to Address Them

### Misconception 1: "Tau is aiming"
**Student says:** "The baseball player uses tau to aim at where the ball will be."

**Correction:**
- "Not quite. Tau doesn't tell you *where* the ball will land—it tells you *when* it will arrive. The player doesn't predict a landing spot and run there. Instead, they continuously adjust their running speed to keep tau constant. They're coupled to the ball's optical expansion, not planning a ballistic trajectory."

### Misconception 2: "Optic flow is about 'seeing motion'"
**Student says:** "Optic flow is when you see things moving."

**Correction:**
- "Close, but there's a critical distinction. Optic flow is structured motion—patterns that specify your heading, speed, and time-to-contact with surfaces. It's not just 'motion blur.' It's lawful, informative change in the optic array."

### Misconception 3: "This is just depth perception"
**Student says:** "The tiles look closer because of depth perception."

**Correction:**
- "Depth perception usually refers to static cues (like binocular disparity or size). Optic flow is different—it's about how the visual world transforms as you move. It's not about estimating distance; it's about directly perceiving your relationship to the environment. The flow specifies 'heading this way at this speed,' not 'that object is 3 meters away.'"

## Wrap-Up (2 min)

**After all presentations, synthesize:**

**Say:**
> "Excellent observations. Here's what I want you to notice: Every example you brought involved **dynamic visual information**—things changing over time. This is the heart of ecological optics.
>
> - Optic flow patterns specify where you're heading.
> - Tau (expansion rate) specifies when you'll arrive.
> - Gap closure rates specify whether you can navigate through an opening.
>
> None of this requires your brain to 'calculate' distance, velocity, or time. The information is **directly available** in the structure of light. That's Gibson's radical claim, and that's what we're unpacking today."

**Transition to discussion:**
> "Keep these examples in mind as we turn to Blau & Wagman Chapter 6. You'll see the formal theory behind what you observed. And on Thursday, we'll test some of these principles in the lab."

## Grading Notes

**Grade on Canvas after class (takes ~10 min for 10 students):**

Use this rubric:

| Criterion | 4 pts (Full) | 3 pts (Good) | 2 pts (Partial) | 0-1 pts (Missing) |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Relevance** | Clear demo of flow/tau/nav | Related but not precise | Tangential connection | Off-topic |
| **Evidence** | Clear, well-captured | Visible but imperfect | Hard to see key moment | No evidence |
| **Analysis** | Identifies specific visual info | Names concept correctly | Vague description | No analysis |
| **Presentation** | Clear, concise, engaging | Understandable | Rushed or unclear | Did not present |

**Feedback tips:**
- For strong examples: "Excellent—your observation of [X] perfectly illustrates [concept]."
- For weak examples: "Good start. To strengthen this, focus on what specific visual property (expansion, flow, gap closure) guides the action."
- For misconceptions: "You identified an interesting case, but this is actually [Y], not [X]. Here's the distinction..."

## Contingency Plans

### If no one did the assignment:
- Have 2-3 backup videos ready (YouTube clips of optic flow, tau examples)
- Frame it as: "Since we don't have field reports today, let me show you what to look for. Your job for next week is to find your own."

### If too many students want to present:
- "We have time for 5 today. If you didn't present, you'll go first next week. But I'll still grade your submission."

### If a student's example doesn't work:
- Don't dismiss it—use it as a teaching moment
- "This is a tricky case. Let's analyze it together. What would make this a clearer example of optic flow?"

## Integration with Rest of Class

**After field reports, transition to discussion:**

1. Reference student examples throughout the discussion
   - "Remember the hallway video? That's global optic flow."
   - "The dog catching the frisbee? That's tau in action."

2. Use examples as anchors for abstract concepts
   - When discussing "center of expansion," pull up the hallway video again

3. Preview Thursday's lab
   - "On Thursday, you'll experience tau yourself when we do the catching task. Think about how the ball's expansion guides your hand movement—just like the dog."

This creates a **concrete → abstract → concrete** arc across the week.
