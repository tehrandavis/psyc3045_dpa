### Question 1
**What is the fundamental difference between *Radiant Light* and *Ambient Light*?**

*   [ ] A. Radiant light comes from a source and radiates in all directions; Ambient light is structured by reflection off surfaces and converges to a point of observation.
*   [ ] B. Radiant light is visible to the human eye, whereas ambient light is invisible energy.
*   [ ] C. Radiant light provides information about the environment, whereas ambient light is just "noise" that the brain must filter out.
*   [ ] D. Radiant light is studied by psychologists, whereas ambient light is studied by physicists.

### Question 2
**Regarding the information variable "Tau" ($\tau$), what is the "Scope Problem"?**

*   [ ] A. Tau only perfectly specifies time-to-contact under limited conditions (e.g., constant velocity, spherical objects), yet organisms seemingly rely on it.
*   [ ] B. Tau relies on the organism knowing the exact distance to the object, which is impossible to measure directly.
*   [ ] C. Tau is only effective for very slow-moving objects; it fails at high speeds.
*   [ ] D. Tau is a "computed" variable rather than a "detected" one, violating the principles of direct perception.

### Question 3
**In a "Moving Room" experiment, what happens when the walls move *forward* (toward the observer) while the floor remains stationary?**

*   [ ] A. The observer perceives themselves as swaying *backward* and compensates by swaying/falling *forward*.
*   [ ] B. The observer perceives themselves as swaying *forward* and compensates by swaying/falling *backward*.
*   [ ] C. The observer ignores the room movement because their feet are stable on the floor (mechanical dominance).
*   [ ] D. The observer becomes dizzy and sits down, but does not sway in any specific direction.

### Question 4
**How do humans combine Optic Flow and Egocentric Direction when steering toward a goal?**

*   [ ] A. Humans use a weighted combination of both cues, relying *more* on Optic Flow as the environment becomes richer (e.g., more texture).
*   [ ] B. Humans ignore Optic Flow and rely solely on Egocentric Direction (keeping the goal centered).
*   [ ] C. Humans ignore Egocentric Direction and rely solely on Optic Flow (aligning the Focus of Expansion).
*   [ ] D. Humans switch back and forth: they use Flow for running and Direction for walking.

### Question 5
**What specific information is provided by *Global Flow*?**

*   [ ] A. It specifies the movement of the observer themselves (Self-Motion / Ego-Motion).
*   [ ] B. It specifies the movement of objects within the scene (e.g., a car driving past).
*   [ ] C. It provides information about the depth and layout of static surfaces.
*   [ ] D. It specifies the chemical composition of surfaces based on light absorption.
