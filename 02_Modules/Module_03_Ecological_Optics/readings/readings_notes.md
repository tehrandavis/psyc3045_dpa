# 📚 Week 3 Reading Notes: Ecological Optics

This file contains links to the literature notes for this week's primary empirical readings.

## 🏃 Visual Proprioception (The Moving Room)
*   [[Lee and Aronson - 1974 - Visual proprioceptive control of standing in human infants]]
    *   *Core Concept:* Vision is a proprioceptive sense; optic flow overrides mechanical feedback in infants.

## ⚾ Interception & Tau (The Deflating Ball)
*   [[Savelsbergh et al. - 1991 - Grasping tau]]
    *   *Core Concept:* Catching is timed by the inverse rate of expansion ($\tau$), not by calculating distance/velocity.

## 🚶 Locomotion & Steering (The Great Debate)
*   [[Warren et al. - 2001 - Optic flow is used to control human walking]]
    *   *Core Concept:* Humans flexibly weight **Optic Flow** and **Egocentric Direction** depending on environmental texture.

## 💥 Collision Severity (Tau-dot)
*   [[Kim et al. - 1993 - Optical Information About the Severity of Upcoming Contacts]]
    *   *Core Concept:* We perceive the *severity* (hardness) of a collision via the rate of change of tau ($\dot{\tau}$).
