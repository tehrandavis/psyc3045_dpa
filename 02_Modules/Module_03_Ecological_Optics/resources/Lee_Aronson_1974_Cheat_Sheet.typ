== "Visual proprioceptive control of standing in human infants"

*Core Question:* Why do you stay upright? Is it because of what you _feel_ or what you _see_?

== Key Terminology

  [*Visual Proprioception*], [Seeing your own movement. Information about your body's actions obtained through vision.],
  [*Exteroception*], [Information about the outside world (objects, events) extrinsic to you.],
  [*Optic Flow*], [The pattern of movement in the eyes caused by relative motion between the observer and the scene.],
  [*Postural Control*], [The continuous "fine-tuning" of muscles to keep your body vertical and prevent falling.],
)

== The Research Question

*The Classical View:* Balance is handled by "mechanoreceptors" (inner ear/vestibular system and sensors in your joints/muscles). Vision is just for looking at things "out there."

*The Ecological Question:* Can vision _directly_ control your balance? If we trick your eyes into thinking you are swaying, will your body react even if your "inner ear" says you are standing still?

== The Experimental Setup: The "Moving Room"

Lee & Aronson built a "Moving Room"---three walls and a ceiling suspended just above a stationary floor.

- *What stays still?* The floor (what infants are actually standing on).
- *What moves?* The walls and ceiling (the entire visual field).
- *The Participants:* Infants (13--16 months old) just learning to stand.

*Think About the Manipulation:*
- If the room moves *toward* the infant, what does the optic flow pattern specify? Does it look like the infant is moving, or the world?
- If you're trying to maintain balance and you "see" yourself swaying forward, what should your body do to compensate?
- What happens if your visual system is "wrong" but your body acts on it anyway?

== What to Look For in the Results

When the room moved, the infants reacted---often dramatically. As you read, pay attention to:
- If the room moves *forward* $arrow$ What does the infant "see"? (Self swaying backward? Forward? Room moving?)
- If the infant perceives themselves swaying backward $arrow$ What should the body do to correct it?
- What happens when you apply the "correct" postural response to the "wrong" visual information?
- What percentage of trials showed a response? Is this a weak effect or a strong one?

== Think about it...

- *Why do infants fall?* Are they being "pushed" by the room, or is their own brain telling their muscles to move?
- *What is "Visual Proprioception"?* If an infant falls because of a visual illusion while their feet are on solid ground, what does that tell us about how we perceive our own bodies?
- *Is vision "more potent" than feeling?* The infants' mechanical sensors (feet, ankles, inner ear) were correctly reporting that the floor wasn't moving. Why did the infants ignore their feet and trust their eyes instead?
- *Why test infants?* Why not just use healthy adults?
