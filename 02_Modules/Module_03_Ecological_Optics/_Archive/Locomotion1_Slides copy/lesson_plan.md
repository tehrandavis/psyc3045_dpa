# Lesson Plan: Module 03 - Ecological Optics
## "The Geometry of Information"

**Date:** [Tomorrow's Date]
**Goal:** Move students from "theory" (reading about ambient light) to "experience" (feeling how vision controls their own balance and steering).

---

## Part 1: Field Report Debrief & Warm-up (20-30 min)
*Goal: Validate student observations and correct misconceptions about "information."

### 1. The Gallery Walk (Discussion)
*   **Prompt:** "Who found a clear example of **Tau** (timing) vs. **Flow** (steering/balance)?"
*   **Activity:** Select 3 students to share their findings.
*   **Critical Question:** "Don't just describe the object. Describe the **optic array**. Was it expanding? flowing globally? shearing?"
    *   *Example:* "If you filmed a car stop, did it 'loom'? That's Tau."
    *   *Example:* "If you walked down a hall, did the walls 'stream' past? That's Global Flow."

### 2. The "Scope Problem" (Quiz Q2 Review)
*   **Context:** Golonka reading (Scope Problem).
*   **Ask:** "Did anyone find an example where the optics 'lied'? (e.g., a small object moving fast vs. large object moving slow?)"
*   **Key Point:** Information isn't always perfect physics, but it's "specific enough" for survival.

### 3. The "Impossible" Task
*   **Ask:** "Did anyone try to move *without* creating flow?" (e.g., keeping head perfectly still).
*   **Key Point:** **Action generates Information.** You cannot separate the two.

## Part 2: Interactive Lecture (45-50 min)
*Using `Module03_Lecture.html`. Focus on "Active" participation.*

### A. The Core Theory (Slides 1-3)
*   **Concept:** Radiant vs. Ambient Light.
*   **Interactive Demo: "Lights Out"**
    *   *Action:* Turn off the classroom lights (leaving screen on).
    *   *Ask:* "Is there still radiant light?" (Yes, from screen).
    *   *Ask:* "Is there ambient light?" (Yes, you can see edges/silhouettes).
    *   *Ask:* "If I filled the room with thick fog, what happens?"
    *   *Takeaway:* Fog increases radiant energy (scatter) but destroys ambient structure. **We see structure, not brightness.**

### B. Visual Proprioception (Slides 4-5)
*   **Concept:** Vision balances the body (Moving Room).
*   **Interactive Demo: "The One-Leg Stand"**
    1.  Ask everyone to stand up.
    2.  "Stand on one leg. Look at the wall. Easy?"
    3.  "Now... **close your eyes**." (Watch for wobbles/falls).
    4.  *Ask:* "Why did you fall? Your inner ear (vestibular) is fine. Your feet (mechanoreceptors) are fine."
    5.  *Takeaway:* You lost **Visual Proprioception**. Vision is your "anchor."

### C. Heading & Steering (Slides 6-8)
*   **Concept:** Warren's "Great Debate" (Flow vs. Direction).
*   **Interactive Demo: "The Walk"**
    *   *Action:* Have a student walk from back to front, tracking a target.
    *   *Ask Class:* "Are they walking straight? How do you know?"
    *   *Ask Student:* "What are you doing with your eyes? Are you centering the target?"
    *   *Reveal (Slide 8):* "It depends on the texture!"
    *   *Takeaway:* If this room were a dark void (sparse), they would walk a curved path. Because we have texture (floor tiles, desks), they use **Optic Flow** to walk straight.

### D. Tau & Collision (Slides 9-11)
*   **Concept:** Time-to-Contact ($\tau$) and Collision Severity ($\dot{\tau}$).
*   **Interactive Demo: "The Flinch"**
    *   *Action:* Gently toss a soft foam ball (or crumpled paper) at a student in the front row.
    *   *Observation:* They will flinch/catch/blink automatically.
    *   *Ask:* "Did you calculate Distance / Velocity?"
    *   *Ask:* "Did you solve a physics equation?"
    *   *Takeaway:* No. Your visual system detected **Expansion**. It was a reflex.
    *   *Connect to Slide 10:* "If this paper ball could **deflate** in mid-air, you would have gotten hit in the face." (Because $\tau$ would say "it's far away").

## Part 3: Wrap Up (10 min)

### 1. Muddy Points
*   "What is still confusing about **Radiant vs. Ambient** light?"
*   "Does anyone still feel like 'vision is for objects'?"

### 2. Preview: Affordances
*   "Now that we know *how* we get information (Optics)...
*   "Next week: **What does that information tell us?**"
*   "It tells us what we can DO. (Affordances)."
