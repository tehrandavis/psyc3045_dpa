# Module 03 - Ecological Optics & The Geometry of Information

Last week we talked about the **axioms**—the foundational assumptions that separate ecological psychology from the traditional "computer metaphor." This week, we get concrete: *How does light actually carry information about the world?*

Our key claim is that light doesn't just illuminate objects so your brain can "compute" what they are. Light is *structured* by the environment—by surfaces, textures, edges, and your own movement through space. That structure *is* the information for perception.

This week's readings take you from theory to evidence:

**By the end of this week, here's what you should be able to do:**

*   **Differentiate Radiant vs. Ambient Light:** Explain why physics cares about where light *comes from* (energy), but ecology cares about where light *is* (structure).
*   **Define the Ambient Optic Array:** Describe how the environment "structures" light at a point of observation through texture, occlusion, and perspective.
*   **Explain Visual Proprioception:** Use the "Moving Room" experiment to explain how vision functions as a sense for self-motion, often overriding touch and balance.
*   **Describe Visual Control of Steering:** Explain how humans combine egocentric direction and optic flow to control where they walk, and how environmental structure affects this weighting.
*   **Connect Optic Flow to Action:** Understand how optic flow variables (tau for *timing*, heading for *steering*) provide direct information for controlling different aspects of movement.

## Required Readings (For This Week)

### 1. Blau & Wagman, Chapter 6: Ecological Optics
*   This chapter introduces the "Geometry of Information." Pay close attention to the distinction between **Radiant Light** and **Ambient Light** as well as examples of the importance of the optical array and how it "specifies" the environment.

*   **The Optic Array:** How does a static room create a structured "quilt" of light at your eye?
*   **Global vs. Local Flow:** What is the difference between an object moving toward you and *you* moving toward an object?

### 2. Golonka & Wilson: What Kind of Thing is Information?
*   This blog post uses **tau** (time-to-contact) as a case study to explain what we mean by "information" in ecological psychology. The key idea: information variables are **higher-order relations** that remain invariant—patterns you can detect directly, not values you compute.
*   **Detection vs. Computation:** What's the difference between detecting a pattern (like tau) and calculating a value (like distance/velocity)? Why does this distinction matter for Gibson's approach?
*   **The Scope Problem:** If tau only works for constant-velocity, spherical objects, why is it still useful theoretically? What does this tell us about ecological information in general?
*   Blog post: [What kind of thing is information?](https://psychsciencenotes.blogspot.com/2015/04/what-kind-of-thing-is-information.html)

### 3. Lee & Aronson (1974): Visual Proprioception
*   This short paper (4 pages) describes the famous **"Moving Room"** experiment and the idea of visual proprioception (sense of self-motion)
*   **Why do healthy toddlers fall over when the walls move, even though the floor is perfectly stable? What does this tell us about which sense "rules" balance? Can you think of examples of a "moving room" that you may have encountered outside of the lab?

### 4. Warren et al. (2001): Optic Flow & Visual Control of Steering
*   We've seen optic flow used for balance (Lee & Aronson). Now: how do we use it to steer when we walk? This paper tackles a 50-year debate: Do we steer by **Egocentric Direction** (keeping the goal centered) or by **Optic Flow** (aligning with the Focus of Expansion)? Pay attention to terms like **FOE, Heading, Motion Parallax, Control Law,** and **Adaptive Weighting**.
*   **What happens when you decouple direction and flow using VR?** Which cue do people trust? Why would a dark hallway provide different steering information than a textured forest? What does it mean to say the visual system is "adaptive"—fixed rule or flexible controller?
*   **Don't let the equation scare you.** There's a cheat sheet uploaded to help decode it. Focus on the concept: steering is driven by combining both cues with weights that change based on environmental richness.
