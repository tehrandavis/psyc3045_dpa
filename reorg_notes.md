## Target Structure (from History Systems Psychology)
- `00_Admin`
- `01_Design`
- `02_Modules`
- `03_Assessments`
- `04_Resources`
- `05_Student_Work`
- `06_Assistant_Context`

| `Schedule_Review_Analysis.md`| `01_Design/` | Review/Design |
| `analysis/` | `01_Design/Analysis/` | Teacher reflections/checks |
| `modules/` | `02_Modules/` | Core content |
| `lecture_slides/` | `02_Modules/lecture_slides/` | Matches HSP structure |
| `activities/` | `02_Modules/Activities/` | Keep content modules together |
| `readings/` | `04_Resources/Readings/` | Matches HSP structure |
| `assignments/` | `03_Assessments/Assignments/` | Direct match |
| `quizzes/` | `03_Assessments/Quizzes/` | Direct match |
| `assistant/` | `06_Assistant_Context/` | Direct match |
| `nikita_course/` | `04_Resources/Archives/Nikita_Course/` | External reference |
| `UCedu_DPA/` | `04_Resources/Archives/UCedu_DPA/` | External reference (Assuming old course material) |

## Questions to Resolve
- Confirmed: HSP puts `lecture_slides` in `02_Modules`.
- Confirmed: HSP puts `Readings` in `04_Resources`.
