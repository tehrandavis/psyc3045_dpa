# Weekly Planning Template: Discussion + Activity Integration

**Course:** Dynamics of Perception & Action
**Weekly Rhythm:** Tuesday (Seminar/Discussion) + Thursday (Lab/Activity)
**Duration:** 75 min per session

---

## 🎯 Design Principle: Experience → Theory → Application Cycle

The weekly rhythm creates a **feedback loop** between embodied experience and conceptual understanding:

```
Week N Tuesday (Activity Day):
   Experience phenomenon → Generate questions
      ↓
Week N Thursday (Discussion Day):
   Reading explains phenomenon → Deepen understanding
      ↓
Week N+1 Tuesday (Activity Day):
   Apply concepts → Test predictions → New questions
```

**Result:** Students cycle between doing and thinking, building intuition and theory together.

## 🔄 Common Weekly Patterns (Choose Based on Content)

### **Pattern A: Activity → Discussion (Recommended for New Concepts)**

**Tuesday (Activity Day):** Experience phenomenon → Generate confusion/questions
**Thursday (Discussion Day):** Reading resolves confusion → Deepen theory

**Example:**
- **Tue:** Ebbinghaus demo → "How did my hand know the real size?"
- **Thu:** Blau & Wagman Ch 3 (Axioms) → "Direct perception of affordances"

**When to Use:**
- Introducing counterintuitive concepts (e.g., direct perception, coordination dynamics)
- Building from concrete to abstract
- High student engagement needed

---

### **Pattern B: Discussion → Activity (Good for Testing Theory)**

**Tuesday (Discussion Day):** Reading introduces theory → Generate predictions
**Thursday (Activity Day):** Demo tests predictions → Apply theory

**Example:**
- **Tue:** Gibson Ch 5 (Optic Flow) → "Tau specifies time-to-contact"
- **Thu:** Optic flow demo → "Can we detect tau? Does it guide braking?"

**When to Use:**
- Theory is accessible from reading alone
- Demo serves as test/application of theory
- Consolidating prior learning

---

### **Pattern C: Dual Activities (Rare, for Complex Topics)**

**Tuesday (Activity 1):** Baseline demo
**Thursday (Activity 2):** Variation or extension

**Example:**
- **Tue:** Finger oscillation (in-phase vs anti-phase)
- **Thu:** Add external pacing → Observe phase transitions

**When to Use:**
- Complex phenomena requiring multiple exposures
- Building toward a cumulative insight
- Mid-semester when students have strong conceptual foundation

**Note:** Assign reading between sessions to provide theoretical scaffolding.

---

### **Pattern D: Discussion → Discussion (Theory-Heavy Weeks)**

**Tuesday (Discussion Day):** Foundational reading
**Thursday (Discussion Day):** Application or critique reading

**Example:**
- **Tue:** Blau & Wagman Ch 3 (9 Axioms)
- **Thu:** Blau & Wagman Ch 4 (Planimeter metaphor)

**When to Use:**
- Building theoretical foundation early in semester
- Review/synthesis weeks before exams
- Preparing for major conceptual shift

**Warning:** Risk of passivity. Use Discussion Day Protocol rigorously (student questions, active engagement).

---

## 🗓️ Semester-Level Planning: Mapping Patterns to Arc

### Early Semester (Weeks 1-4): Build Intuition
**Dominant Pattern:** Activity → Discussion
**Why:** Students need embodied experience to grasp counterintuitive concepts (direct perception, ecological optics).

**Example:**
- **Week 1:** Assumptions demo → Reading on Standard Story
- **Week 2:** Optic flow demo → Reading on tau
- **Week 3:** Ebbinghaus → Reading on Axioms

---

### Mid-Semester (Weeks 5-9): Deepen Theory
**Dominant Pattern:** Discussion → Activity
**Why:** Students can now predict phenomena from theory; demos test their understanding.

**Example:**
- **Week 5:** Reading on affordances → Stair-climbing demo
- **Week 6:** Reading on dynamic touch → Wielding demo
- **Week 7:** Reading on coordination → Finger oscillation

---

### Late Semester (Weeks 10-14): Synthesis & Application
**Dominant Pattern:** Discussion → Discussion or Student-Led Activities
**Why:** Students integrate across topics; less instructor-led demo, more student application.

**Example:**
- **Week 10:** Debate reading (Does direct perception fail for X?)
- **Week 11:** Student-designed demo (groups propose and run)
- **Week 12:** Capstone discussion (Synthesis across course)

---

## 📋 Master Planning Checklist (Use at Semester Start)

### Step 1: Identify Core Concepts (One per week)
- [ ] List 12-14 core concepts for the semester
- [ ] Sequence from concrete → abstract or simple → complex

### Step 2: Match Concepts to Demos & Readings
- [ ] For each concept, identify:
  - **Demo:** What embodied experience reveals this?
  - **Reading:** What text explains this?

### Step 3: Assign Weekly Pattern
- [ ] For each week, choose pattern (A, B, C, or D)
- [ ] Early semester: Favor Pattern A (Activity → Discussion)
- [ ] Mid-semester: Favor Pattern B (Discussion → Activity)
- [ ] Late semester: Favor Pattern D or student-led

### Step 4: Build Week-by-Week Plan
- [ ] Use Weekly Planning Template for each week
- [ ] Ensure pre-class tasks are distributed (not all weeks heavy)
- [ ] Plan "light weeks" before exams or after intense demos

### Step 5: Create Callbacks & Threads
- [ ] Each week should reference prior weeks ("Remember the Ebbinghaus demo?")
- [ ] Identify 2-3 "big ideas" that recur across semester
- [ ] Plan cumulative synthesis discussions (Week 7, Week 14)

## 🧰 Quick Reference: Protocol Selection Guide

| Situation | Use This Protocol |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Students need to experience phenomenon first** | Activity Day Protocol |
| **Reading introduces a testable theory** | Discussion Day Protocol (with prediction task) |
| **Concept is highly abstract (e.g., "direct perception")** | Activity Day first, then Discussion Day |
| **Students have misconceptions to surface** | Discussion Day with pre-class questions |
| **Consolidating prior learning** | Activity Day (apply theory) or Discussion Day (synthesize readings) |
| **Building toward complex synthesis** | Dual Discussion Days or Discussion → Activity |

---

## 📝 Example: Week 3 (Actual Course Instance)

### Week 3: Action vs. Perception & The Axioms

**Core Concept:** Direct perception challenges the Standard Story; perception is task-specific, not a single internal representation.

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Experience dissociation between conscious judgment and motor control.
2. Define the core axioms of Ecological Realism.
3. Connect the Planimeter metaphor to direct perception.

---

#### **Tuesday, Jan 27: Activity + Discussion Hybrid**

**Protocol:** Activity_Day_Protocol.md (Segment I-II) + Discussion_Day_Protocol.md (Segment III-IV)

**Focus:** Ebbinghaus demo reveals task specificity; discussion explores theoretical implications.

**Pre-Class Student Task:**
- [ ] None (catch-up from cancelled Jan 22 class)

**Pre-Class Instructor Prep:**
- [x] Print Ebbinghaus illusion images
- [x] Prepare 3D disks for grasping task
- [x] Write discussion questions for Axioms & Planimeters

**In-Class Structure (75 min):**
| Time | Segment | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| 20-25 min | **Lab: Ebbinghaus Demo** | Perception task (illusion) + Action task (grasping) → Dissociation |
| 15 min | **Pivot: Analyzing the "Itch"** | Why did hand get it right? Michaels (2000): Task specificity, not two systems |
| 30 min | **Discussion: Axioms & Planimeters** | Use discussion questions (already appended to lesson plan) |
| 10-15 min | **Prime: Ecological Optics** | Whiteboard sketch (Radiant vs Ambient Light) → Hook for Thursday |

**Key Deliverable:** Students experience perception-action dissociation and can articulate why "two visual systems" explanation is problematic.

**Assignment for Thursday:**
- [ ] Reading: Blau & Wagman Ch 6 (Ecological Optics)
- [ ] Pre-Class Task: Submit 1 question + 1 optic flow example
- [ ] Due: Wednesday 11:59 PM

---

#### **Thursday, Jan 29: Discussion Day**

**Protocol:** Discussion_Day_Protocol.md

**Focus:** How does light carry information without being an image?

**Pre-Class Student Task:**
- [ ] Reading: Blau & Wagman Ch 6
- [ ] Submit: 1 confusing question + 1 real-world optic flow example
- [ ] Due: Wednesday 11:59 PM

**Pre-Class Instructor Prep (Wednesday 8 PM):**
- [ ] Review student submissions
- [ ] Cluster questions; select top 3
- [ ] Prepare facilitation notes (anchor concepts, whiteboard sketches)
- [ ] Bring backup slides (optional): Ambient array diagram, optic flow illustration

**In-Class Structure (75 min):**
| Time | Segment | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| 10 min | **Concept Check** | Poll: "Which is ambient light?" (3 images). Clarify misconceptions. |
| 30 min | **Student Questions** | Top 3 questions (e.g., "How is tau different from distance?"). Whiteboard synthesis. |
| 20 min | **Optic Flow Demo** | Video: Car driving. Task: "Pause at 5 points—what specifies collision?" |
| 15 min | **Synthesis** | Return to student examples. "How does your hallway example show structured light?" Preview Tuesday. |

**Key Deliverable:** Students can explain how ambient arrays carry information and connect optic flow to tau.

**Assignment for Next Week:**
- [ ] Quiz on Blau & Wagman Ch 3, 4, 6 (due Tuesday Feb 3, 9 AM)
- [ ] Reading: [Next chapter]

---

#### **Post-Week Reflection (Friday, Jan 30)**

**What Worked:**
- Ebbinghaus demo landed well; students grasped (literally!) the perception-action dissociation.
- Discussion questions were generative; Q3 (Homunculus) sparked debate.
- Student-submitted questions on optic flow were thoughtful (especially "How does tau work if you're accelerating?").

**What Needs Adjustment:**
- "Tau" is still fuzzy for some students. Plan callback/reteach on Feb 3.
- Thursday's optic flow video was too fast; need slower version or ability to pause/replay.

**Callback for Next Week:**
- Revisit tau with a demo (e.g., catching a ball, braking simulation).
- Connect tau to affordances (graspability from Week 3).

## 🎓 Final Note: These Are Living Documents

**Your teaching will evolve:**
- First iteration: Follow protocols closely.
- Mid-semester: Adapt based on student needs (more scaffolding? Less?).
- Next semester: Refine based on what worked.

**Update these templates:**
- Add "What Worked" and "What Failed" notes to protocols.
- Share successful variants with future you (or colleagues).

**Trust the process:**
- Discussion Days feel risky (what if students don't submit good questions?). They will. And even "bad" questions reveal useful confusion.
- Activity Days feel chaotic (what if the demo fails?). It sometimes will. Embrace it as data.

**The goal:** Students who think like ecological psychologists—asking questions, testing predictions, connecting theory to lived experience. These protocols support that goal.
