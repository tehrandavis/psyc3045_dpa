# Activity/Demo Day Protocol

**Course:** Dynamics of Perception & Action
**Format:** Experiential Learning via Demonstrations
**Class Size:** Small (<15 students)
**Duration:** 75 minutes
**Pedagogical Foundation:** Predict-Observe-Explain (POE) + Experiential Learning Cycle

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Students predict phenomenon → Experience it firsthand → Analyze what it reveals → Connect to theory. The demo is the argument.**

---

## 📋 Pre-Class Preparation

### For Students (Optional but Recommended)

**Light Prep Assignment (Due night before):**
```
Optional Pre-Demo Reading/Video: [Short article, textbook section, or 5-min video]

Brief Task (3-5 min):
- What do you predict will happen in [demo name]?
- Why? (Based on what you know so far)

Submission: Post to discussion board or bring written note to class.

Purpose: Primes your thinking; helps me design the demo discussion.
```

**When to Assign:**
- **Complex demos:** If demo requires theoretical background (e.g., coordination dynamics)
- **Skip for simple demos:** If demo is self-explanatory (e.g., Ebbinghaus illusion)

---

### For Instructor (1-2 days before)

**Step 1: Demo Design (30-60 min if new demo)**

Use **Backward Design:**
1. **What concept does this demo reveal?** (e.g., "Perception and action use different information sources")
2. **What's the 'aha' moment?** (e.g., "My hand was right, but my eyes were fooled!")
3. **What's the theoretical payoff?** (e.g., "This challenges the 'single representation' model")

**Step 2: Prepare Materials (20-30 min)**
- [ ] Demo equipment (test it!)
- [ ] Participant instructions (written or verbal script)
- [ ] Data collection method (if applicable): whiteboard table, Google Form, or paper handout
- [ ] Backup plan if demo fails (happens!)

**Step 3: Structure the Session (15-20 min)**
- **Prediction questions:** "What do you think will happen?" "Why?"
- **Observation prompts:** "Watch for X." "What changes when Y?"
- **Analysis questions:** "What does this tell us about [concept]?"
- **Theory connections:** "How does this support/challenge [reading from last week]?"

**Step 4: Safety & Inclusion Check**
- Is the demo physically safe? (e.g., balance tasks need spotters)
- Can all students participate or observe meaningfully?
- Are there opt-out options for those uncomfortable (e.g., body-based demos)?

## 🕐 In-Class Structure (75 min)

### Segment I: Context & Prediction (10-15 min)

**Goal:** Establish the puzzle; activate prior knowledge; generate predictions.

**Structure:**

1. **Frame the Phenomenon (3-5 min):**
   - "Today we're investigating [phenomenon]."
   - "This connects to [last week's concept / this week's reading]."
   - **The Hook:** "Here's the puzzle..." (State the conceptual tension or question)

2. **Activate Prior Knowledge (3 min):**
   - "What do we already know about [related concept]?"
   - "Based on [reading/theory], what should happen?"
   - Quick whiteboard brainstorm or think-pair-share

3. **Predictions (4-7 min):**
   - **Individual:** "On your paper, predict: What will happen and why?" (2 min silent writing)
   - **Share:** Volunteers share predictions; record on board (3-5 min)
   - **Why this matters:** "These predictions are hypotheses. Let's test them."

**Facilitation Notes:**
- **Don't give away the answer.** Let them be wrong (productively).
- **Record predictions visibly** (whiteboard/slide) so you can return to them later.
- **Validate uncertainty:** "It's OK not to know. That's why we experiment."

### Segment II: Experience the Demo (20-30 min)

**Goal:** Students observe or participate in the phenomenon firsthand.

**Format Options:**

#### **Option A: Whole-Class Demo (Instructor-Led)**
*Example: Ebbinghaus illusion, optic flow video*

**Structure:**
1. **Setup (2 min):** Explain task. "You'll see X. Your job is to Y."
2. **Run Demo (5-10 min):** Execute. Ensure all students can observe clearly.
3. **Immediate Reaction (3 min):** "What did you notice?" "What surprised you?"
4. **Data Collection (5 min):** Record observations on board or shared doc.
5. **Variants (5-10 min):** Repeat with variations (e.g., "Now try with eyes closed")

#### **Option B: Individual/Pair Participation (Stations or Sequential)**
*Example: Dynamic touch (wielding rods), stair climbing, finger oscillation*

**Structure:**
1. **Instructions (3 min):** Demonstrate task; clarify what to attend to.
2. **Rotate Stations (15-20 min):**
   - Small groups rotate through stations (or individuals try sequentially)
   - Instructor circulates, asks probing questions
   - Students record observations on worksheet
3. **Debrief (5 min):** "What patterns did you notice across conditions?"

#### **Option C: Collaborative Data Collection**
*Example: Coordination dynamics (everyone does finger oscillation simultaneously)*

**Structure:**
1. **Baseline (3 min):** Everyone tries task. "What's easy? What's hard?"
2. **Systematic Variation (10-15 min):** Change one variable (e.g., speed, coupling). Collect data (show of hands, tally on board).
3. **Pattern Recognition (5 min):** "What do the data show?" Graph results on board.
4. **Surprise (2 min):** Highlight unexpected result. "Why did this happen?"

**Facilitation Notes:**
- **Normalize confusion:** "This feels weird—that's normal."
- **Encourage observation language:** "Describe what you see, not what you think it means."
- **Handle demo failures gracefully:** "Interesting! Why didn't it work? What does that tell us?"

---

### Segment III: Analysis & Theory Connection (25-30 min)

**Goal:** Translate embodied experience into conceptual understanding.

**Structure:**

1. **Return to Predictions (5 min):**
   - Display original predictions from Segment I
   - "Which predictions were confirmed? Which were wrong?"
   - "Why were we wrong?" (This is where learning happens)

2. **Guided Analysis (10-15 min):**
   - **Observation → Interpretation:** "What did the demo show us?"
   - **Theoretical Connection:** "How does this relate to [concept from reading]?"
   - Use **Socratic questioning:**
     - "Why did X happen when Y changed?"
     - "What information was available to the perceiver/actor?"
     - "What does this tell us about [theoretical claim]?"
   - **Whiteboard synthesis:** Draw model, label variables, show relationships

3. **Challenge the Theory (5-7 min):**
   - "Does this demo *prove* [theory]? What else could explain it?"
   - "What would [alternative theory] predict instead?"
   - "What experiment would distinguish between explanations?"

**Facilitation Tips:**
- **Use student language from observations:** "Sarah said she felt 'pulled.' What does that mean theoretically?"
- **Push beyond description to mechanism:** "OK, but *how* did your hand know the size?"
- **Embrace ambiguity:** Not every demo has a tidy answer. "Researchers still debate this."

---

### Segment IV: Synthesis & Extension (10-15 min)

**Goal:** Consolidate learning; connect to broader course themes; preview next steps.

**Structure:**

1. **Conceptual Summary (5 min):**
   - "So what did we learn today?" (Invite student summary)
   - **You synthesize:** "The key insight: [core concept]."
   - **Connect to course arc:** "This builds on [prior week]. Next week, we'll extend this to [future topic]."

2. **Real-World Application (3-5 min):**
   - "Where do you see this phenomenon in everyday life?"
   - "How might this apply to [design, robotics, sports, accessibility]?"
   - Students share ideas; you validate and extend

3. **Preview & Assignment (2-5 min):**
   - "On Tuesday, we'll discuss [reading] that explains *why* this happens."
   - **Assignment:** "For next time, write a 1-page reflection: What did today's demo reveal about [concept]? Use evidence from the demo and the reading."

**Exit Ticket (Optional, 2 min):**
- "One thing that surprised you" + "One connection to theory" (collect on way out)

---

## 📊 Post-Class Follow-Up

### For Instructor (Same day or next day)

**Step 1: Reflect (10 min)**
- Did the demo reveal the intended concept?
- What surprised students (in a good or bad way)?
- What needs re-teaching or clarification?

**Step 2: Document (5 min)**
- Save demo setup notes (what worked, what to change next time)
- Record any student insights (use in future lectures/papers)

**Step 3: Connect to Next Session (5 min)**
- Plan callback: "Remember Thursday's demo? Today's reading explains it."
- If concept was confusing, design follow-up activity or discussion

---

## 🔄 Variants & Adaptations

### If Demo Fails or Results Are Ambiguous
**Embrace It:**
- "This is real science! Sometimes things don't work. Why not?"
- Treat failure as data: "What conditions are necessary for this to work?"
- Pivot to thought experiment: "If it *had* worked, what would we learn?"

### If Students Are Passive During Demo
**Increase Participation:**
- Give everyone a role (timer, data recorder, observer of specific variable)
- Use think-pair-share before whole-class discussion
- Ask prediction questions mid-demo: "Pause. What happens next?"

### If Class is Very Small (<8 students)
- Everyone participates in demo (no observers)
- More time for individual sharing in debrief
- Can do multiple trials or variants

### If Class is Larger (15-20 students)
- Use stations or small groups for participation demos
- Assign specific observation roles (e.g., "Group A watches hand, Group B watches eyes")
- Pool data across groups for analysis

## 🎓 Pedagogical Rationale

**Predict-Observe-Explain (POE):**
- **Predict:** Activates prior knowledge, creates cognitive investment
- **Observe:** Provides concrete, embodied evidence
- **Explain:** Reconciles prediction with observation, driving conceptual change

**Experiential Learning Cycle (Kolb):**
1. **Concrete Experience:** Do the demo
2. **Reflective Observation:** Analyze what happened
3. **Abstract Conceptualization:** Connect to theory
4. **Active Experimentation:** Apply to new contexts

**Backward Design:**
- **Desired Result:** Students understand [concept] through embodied experience
- **Evidence:** Can explain demo results using theoretical framework
- **Learning Experience:** Demo → Analysis → Theory (not theory → demo)

**UDL:**
- **Multiple Representations:** Embodied (demo) + Visual (whiteboard) + Verbal (discussion)
- **Multiple Engagement:** Active (participate) + Observational (watch others) + Reflective (analysis)
- **Multiple Expression:** Physical participation, verbal explanation, written reflection

## 📝 Example Timeline (Real Instance: Ebbinghaus Demo, Tuesday Jan 27)

**Pre-Class:**
- Print Ebbinghaus illusion images
- Prepare poker chips or 3D disks for grasping
- Write prediction question on board: "Which inner circle is bigger?"

**In-Class:**
- **10 min:** Context: "Standard Story says we build mental images. Let's test it."
- **Predictions:** Students estimate size; record on board.
- **5 min:** Perception task: "Which looks bigger?" (Illusion works)
- **10 min:** Action task: "Reach and grasp the center disk." Measure peak grip aperture (PGA).
- **Result:** PGA scales to real size, not illusory size.
- **15 min:** Analysis: "How did your hand get it right if your brain's image was wrong?"
- **Discussion:** Introduce Michaels (2000): Task specificity, not two systems.
- **10 min:** Synthesis: Hand detected graspability (tau), not size-in-context. Transition to Axioms.

**Post-Class:**
- Reflect: Demo worked well; students grasped (pun intended) the concept.
- Note: Need to reinforce "task specificity" vs "two visual systems" on Thursday.

## 🔗 Integration with Discussion Days

**Activity Days often precede Discussion Days:**
- **Activity Day:** Experience phenomenon, raise questions
- **Discussion Day:** Reading explains the phenomenon, deepens understanding

**Example Sequence:**
- **Tuesday (Activity):** Ebbinghaus demo → "How did the hand know?"
- **Thursday (Discussion):** Blau & Wagman Ch 3 → Axioms of Direct Perception explain it

**Feedback Loop:**
- Observations from Activity Day become questions for Discussion Day
- Theory from Discussion Day predicts next Activity Day

## 💡 Common Pitfalls & Solutions

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Demo doesn't reveal concept clearly** | Add explicit contrast (e.g., "Now try with eyes closed") |
| **Students see it as magic trick, not science** | Emphasize prediction and mechanism: "Not *what* happened, but *why*" |
| **Too much time on demo, not enough analysis** | Set strict time limits; use timer; prioritize Segment III |
| **Passive observation (only 1-2 students participate)** | Give everyone a role; use think-pair-share; rotate participants |
| **Demo fails** | Embrace failure; treat as data; pivot to thought experiment or video |
| **Students don't connect demo to theory** | Explicitly scaffold: "This demo shows [concept]. How? Because [mechanism]." |
