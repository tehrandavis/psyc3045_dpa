# Discussion Day Protocol (Option A Model)

**Course:** Dynamics of Perception & Action
**Format:** Question-Driven Seminar
**Class Size:** Small (<15 students)
**Duration:** 75 minutes
**Pedagogical Foundation:** Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) + Backward Design

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Students generate questions and examples from readings → You facilitate exploration of their questions → Class becomes collaborative sense-making, not knowledge delivery.**

---

## 📋 Pre-Class Preparation

### For Students (Due 24 hours before class)

**Assignment Template:**
```
Reading: [Chapter/Article]

Submit via [Canvas/Email] by [Day] 11:59 PM:

1. **One Confusing Question:** What concept, claim, or argument from the reading
   confused you or sparked curiosity? Frame as a question.

2. **One Real-World Example:** Identify one instance from your daily life where
   you observed [core concept from reading]. Describe it briefly (2-3 sentences).

Grading: Completion only (not quality). This helps me design Thursday's discussion.
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Low stakes:** Completion grade removes performance anxiety
- **Dual function:** Questions reveal confusion; examples show engagement
- **Ownership:** Students arrive having already thought; they're invested
- **Diagnostic:** You see patterns of confusion before class

---

### For Instructor (Night Before or Morning Of)

**Step 1: Review Submissions (20-30 min)**
- Read all student questions and examples
- **Cluster themes:** Group similar questions (e.g., "What does 'direct' mean?" + "How can perception be unmediated?" = Cluster: "Direct Perception")
- **Select Top 3 Questions:** Choose based on:
  - **Centrality:** Hits core concept from reading
  - **Generativity:** Will spark follow-up discussion
  - **Student interest:** Multiple students asked similar questions

**Step 2: Prepare Facilitation Notes (10-15 min)**
For each selected question:
- **Anchor concept:** What's the core idea from reading?
- **Potential student misconceptions:** Where might they be stuck?
- **Connecting questions:** 2-3 follow-ups to deepen discussion (e.g., "How does this connect to Tuesday's Axiom 6?")
- **Whiteboard sketch:** What diagram/example could clarify?

**Step 3: Organize Materials**
- [ ] Print or display student submissions
- [ ] Whiteboard markers (multiple colors)
- [ ] Backup slides (optional): 2-3 key diagrams from reading (use only if discussion stalls)

## 🕐 In-Class Structure (75 min)

### Segment I: Concept Check (10 min)

**Goal:** Establish shared baseline; surface major misconceptions.

**Format Options:**
- **Poll/Quiz:** "Which of these is an example of [concept]?" (show 3 options)
- **Think-Pair-Share:** "In 30 seconds, explain [core concept] to your neighbor"
- **Whiteboard audit:** "Let's map the reading's argument on the board. What's the main claim?"

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Use student language from submissions (e.g., "Several of you asked about X...")
- Don't lecture; just **clarify** enough to enable discussion
- If major confusion, spend 5 extra min here (steal from Segment IV)

---

### Segment II: Student Questions (30 min)

**Goal:** Deep exploration of student-generated questions.

**Structure:**
1. **Display Question 1** (write on board or project)
   - "Who else wondered about this?" (Show of hands; builds momentum)
   - "Let's work through it together."

2. **Facilitate Discussion (8-10 min per question):**
   - **Restate question:** "So the puzzle is: [paraphrase]?"
   - **Invite responses:** "Who has a hypothesis?" or "What does the reading say?"
   - **Press for evidence:** "Where in the text did you see that?"
   - **Connect ideas:** "How does this relate to [prior concept/week]?"
   - **Whiteboard synthesis:** Draw diagram, annotate, track arguments

3. **Repeat for Questions 2-3**

**Facilitation Tips:**
- **Don't answer too quickly.** Let students struggle productively (10-15 seconds of silence is OK).
- **Redirect, don't lecture:** "That's a theory. What would [Author] say?"
- **Validate confusion:** "This *is* confusing. Even experts debate this."
- **Track participation:** Use checklist to ensure all voices heard across semester

**Variants:**
- **Small Group First (if class is shy):** "Discuss Q1 in pairs for 3 min, then we'll share."
- **Student-Led:** Later in semester, assign a student to facilitate one question

---

### Segment III: Applied Activity (20 min)

**Goal:** Move from abstract discussion to embodied understanding.

**Format Options:**

**Option A: Demo/Observation**
- Show video, run demonstration, or observe phenomenon
- **Task:** "Pause at 3 points. How does this example illustrate [concept]?"
- **Discussion:** Connect back to reading and questions

**Option B: Case Analysis**
- Present scenario (e.g., "Design a robot that uses optic flow to navigate")
- **Small groups (5 min):** Sketch solution using concepts from reading
- **Share (10 min):** Each group presents; class critiques
- **Synthesis (5 min):** "What principle unites these solutions?"

**Option C: Student Examples Deep Dive**
- Select 2-3 compelling student-submitted examples
- **Whole class:** "Does this example really demonstrate [concept]? Why/why not?"
- **Refine:** "How could we strengthen this example?"

**Facilitation Notes:**
- **Link to questions:** "Remember Question 2? This demo tests it."
- **Make it embodied:** If possible, have students move/gesture/try
- **Expect messiness:** Real-world examples are ambiguous; that's the point

---

### Segment IV: Synthesis & Preview (15 min)

**Goal:** Consolidate learning; set up next session.

**Structure:**
1. **Return to Questions (5 min):**
   - "So what's our answer to Question 1 now?"
   - "What's still unclear?" (Acknowledge residual confusion)

2. **Student Example Synthesis (5 min):**
   - "Let's revisit your submitted examples. How do they demonstrate [core concept]?"
   - Pick 1-2 examples; annotate on board

3. **Preview Next Class (5 min):**
   - "On Tuesday, we'll test this with [demo/reading]"
   - "For next time, notice [phenomenon] in your daily life"

**Exit Ticket (Optional):**
- "One thing that clicked today" + "One thing still fuzzy" (1 min to write; collect or post)

---

## 📊 Post-Class Follow-Up

### For Instructor (Within 24 hours)

**Step 1: Reflect (5 min)**
- What question generated best discussion?
- Where did students struggle?
- What needs re-teaching?

**Step 2: Adjust Next Session**
- If concept X was confusing, plan callback/reteach for next class
- If engagement was low, consider different question format or more scaffolding

**Step 3: Communicate (Optional)**
- Post summary to Canvas: "Today we explored [concepts]. Key takeaway: [X]. Still unclear: [Y]—we'll revisit Tuesday."

---

## 🔄 Variants & Adaptations

### If Submissions Are Weak
**Backup Plan:** Have 3-4 questions ready from your reading. Frame as: "Questions I predict you might have..."

### If Discussion Stalls
- **Think-Pair-Share:** "Turn to neighbor, discuss for 2 min"
- **Anchor to Tuesday:** "How does this connect to [prior concept]?"
- **Use backup slides:** Show diagram; ask students to annotate/explain

### If Class is Very Small (<8 students)
- Skip small groups; stay whole class
- Increase individual participation expectations (everyone speaks on each question)

### If Class is Larger (15-20 students)
- Use breakout groups for Segment II (groups tackle different questions, report out)
- Rotate facilitators (assign student to lead one question)

## 🎓 Pedagogical Rationale

**Backward Design:**
- **Desired Result:** Students can grapple with complex concepts, ask good questions, apply ideas
- **Evidence:** Quality of questions, ability to connect reading to examples
- **Learning Experience:** Discussion driven by their questions (active, not passive)

**Active Learning:**
- Pre-class task primes thinking
- In-class = sense-making, not information delivery
- Applied activity embodies concepts

**UDL (Universal Design for Learning):**
- **Multiple Representations:** Reading (text) + whiteboard (visual) + demo (embodied)
- **Multiple Engagement:** Individual (pre-class), pairs (think-pair-share), whole class (discussion)
- **Multiple Expression:** Written questions, verbal discussion, sketching solutions
