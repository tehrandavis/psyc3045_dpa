# Literature Note: Blau & Wagman (2022) - Chapter 2
**Title:** Where We Went Wrong
**Source:** Introduction to Ecological Psychology (2022)
**Week:** 1 (The Computer vs. The Organism)

## Key Concepts
*   **The Theoretical Dead End:** Traditional assumptions lead to an information-starved central executive that cannot verify its own guesses (no feedback).
*   **The "Loan of Intelligence":** Dennett's critique that traditional theories borrow intelligence (to explain intelligence) without paying it back.
*   **Animal-Environment Dualism:** The false separation of organism and environment.
*   **Ecological Assumptions (The Pivot):**
    1.  **Realism:** Kept.
    2.  **Empiricism:** Kept but modified (experience begins before birth; constraints).
    3.  **Active Perception:** Organisms are active explorers, not passive receivers.
    4.  **Complex/Nonlinear Causality:** Replacing local/linear causality (legs of a table metaphor).
    5.  **Direct Perception:** No copy/mediation.
    6.  **Rich Stimulus:** The input is *not* bad if the animal moves.
    7.  **Lawful Information:** The relationship lawfully structures energy.
    8.  **Action-Based Variables:** Replace physics variables (wavelength) with ecological variables (affordances).
    9.  **No Central Executive:** Self-organization replaces the ghost in the machine.

## Summary
Chapter 2 deconstructs the 8 traditional assumptions from Chapter 1 and systematically replaces them with Ecological Assumptions.
*   **The Critique:** If the input is bad, how does the brain know *how* to fix it without already knowing what the world looks like? (The feedback loop is broken).
*   **The Solution:** Stop assuming the input is bad.
*   **The "Retinal Image" Fallacy:** Modern anatomy shows the retina is not a screen. Compound eyes (flies) don't form images but still see.
*   **Movement:** Static perception is an illusion. Movement reveals *invariants* (properties that remain constant) and separates them from variants.
*   **Ecological Laws:** $Relationship \leftrightarrow Information$. The environment lawfully generates information which uniquely specifies the environment.
*   **New Variables:** Instead of "time" and "distance" (physics), we perceive "time-to-contact" and "reachability" (ecology).

## Critical Quotes
*   "This loan of intelligence cannot be repaid."
*   "To achieve explanation and not merely description, we have to banish the central executive entirely."
*   "The ecological approach suggests that movement is not a problem—it is a way of exploring the world... movement is the feature, not the bug."
*   "Fred would need to be a detector but not a detective."
*   "We need to stop using the language of physicists and mathematicians and start using the language of organisms!"

## Connection to Course
*   **Week 1 & 2:** Defines the core shift from "Inferential" to "Direct" perception.
*   **Week 2 Activity:** The discussion of "Movement revealing invariants" directly supports the Tau demo (expansion = approach).
*   **Philosophy:** Establishes the "Animal-Environment System" as the unit of analysis.
