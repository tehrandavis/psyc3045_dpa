## Key Concepts
*   **The Traditional Approach:** The historical collection of assumptions guiding perceptual psychology (e.g., poverty of the stimulus, inference).
*   **Fred's Dilemma:** The problem of how an organism (Fred) perceives an object (apple tree) to satisfy a need (hunger).
*   **Local Causality:** The assumption that A must touch B to cause it (billiard ball model).
*   **Action-at-a-Distance:** The apparent violation of local causality when an object influences an organism without contact.
*   **The "Copy" Theory:** The assumption that a representation (copy) mediates contact with the world.
*   **Poverty of the Stimulus:** The belief that sensory input (retinal image) is ambiguous, 2D, upside-down, and insufficient.
*   **Unconscious Inference:** Helmholtz's proposal that the brain fixes the bad input using learned cues and rules.
*   **The Central Executive:** The homunculus or "ghost in the machine" required to perform the inferences.

## Summary
This chapter establishes the "Traditional View" of perception as a foil for the Ecological approach. It uses "Fred" (an organism) trying to get an apple to illustrate the chain of assumptions that lead to the "Central Executive" problem.
1.  **Realism:** The world exists.
2.  **Empiricism:** We gain knowledge through senses (Tabula Rasa).
3.  **Reliability:** Senses somehow inform us.
4.  **Local Causality:** Leading to the need for a "copy" to bridge the gap between object and observer.
5.  **Mediated Contact:** We perceive the copy, not the world.
6.  **Impoverished Stimulus:** The copy (retinal image) is flawed (2D, static, inverted).
7.  **Correction:** The brain/mind must fix the copy using inference/computation.
8.  **Representation:** We experience the fixed representation, not the raw data.

The chapter argues that these assumptions lead to "unsolvable mysteries" (like the Homunculus problem) and sets the stage for a paradigm shift.

## Critical Quotes
*   "Fred has a problem: he is hungry... What is remarkable about Fred's problem is that it seems unremarkable."
*   "If the world doesn't exist, there's no point in figuring out how we coordinate our activities with it."
*   "The point is that the classical concept of causality is linear. Event A causes event B..."
*   "There is a copy of the world that goes between Fred and the world... The copy is then able to inform his behavior."
*   "The retinal image is flat... distance does not exist... all points are collapsed on a single surface."

## Connection to Course
*   **Week 1:** Contrasts the "Robot" (Computational/Traditional) view described here with the "Organism" (Ecological) view.
*   **Debate:** This chapter provides the ammunition for "Team Algorithm" (we need to calculate distance because the image is flat) and sets up the trap that "Team Law" will exploit (the infinite regress of the central executive).
