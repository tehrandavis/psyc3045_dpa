**Title:** Ecological Haptics and Perception by Touch—Muscles as the Medium
**Source:** Introduction to Ecological Psychology (2022)
**Week:** 4 (Dynamic Touch)

## Key Concepts
*   **Ecological Haptics:** Perception by means of the body (muscles/joints) rather than skin alone.
*   **Dynamic (Effortful) Touch:** Perception of properties via wielding/manipulating objects.
*   **The Inertia Tensor ($I$):** The 3x3 matrix quantifying an object's resistance to rotation in 3D.
    *   **Moments of Inertia ($I_{xx}, I_{yy}, I_{zz}$):** Resistance to rotation (related to length/width).
    *   **Products of Inertia ($I_{xy}, \dots$):** Asymmetries (related to orientation/bent-ness).
*   **Rotational Inertia:** Mass $\times$ Distance$^2$. Why holding a bat at the handle is harder than at the barrel.
*   **Perceived Properties:** Length, Shape, Orientation, Sweet Spot, Heaviness.
*   **Tensegrity (Biotensegrity):** The body as a structure of continuous tension (muscles/fascia) and discontinuous compression (bones).

## Summary
This chapter explores how we feel the world through tools and our own limbs.
*   **The Puzzle:** How does Fred know the length of a tennis racket just by holding the handle?
*   **The Solution:** Rotational Dynamics. When an object is wielded, it resists rotation. This resistance is lawful ($I \propto ML^2$). The brain/body detects $I$ (the "Inertial Array").
*   **Key Findings (Turvey/Solomon/Carello):**
    *   **Length:** Perceived length maps to the principal moment of inertia ($I_{xx}$), not mass.
    *   **Shape:** Perceived shape maps to the *ellipsoid of inertia* (ratios of moments).
    *   **Orientation:** Perceived orientation maps to the *products* of inertia (eigenvectors).
    *   **Heaviness:** Is actually "move-ability" (unwieldiness).
*   **Tool Use:** We perceive the "sweet spot" (center of percussion) via haptics.
*   **Proprioception:** We feel the position of our own limbs via the same inertial invariants.

## Critical Quotes
*   "Fred knows all of these things... based on the structured forces that he encounters at a point of observation (in this case, his grasp position)."
*   "Inertia... is resistance to being moved. Specifically, [he] has to overcome its rotational inertia—its resistance to being rotated about an axis."
*   "The medium is not the message... what we perceive is not pressure on the skin or muscles; it is the usability of a tool."
*   "The body is best thought of as a system than as a machine... the musculoskeletal system is a biotensegrity structure."

## Connection to Course
*   **Week 4 Activity:** "The Wielding Game" is a direct replication of the Solomon & Turvey (1988) rod length experiment described here.
*   **Concept:** Explains why $L^2$ matters (the tensor math).
