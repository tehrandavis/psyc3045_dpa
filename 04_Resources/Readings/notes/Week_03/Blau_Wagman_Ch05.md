**Title:** Affordances—What Is Perceived
**Source:** Introduction to Ecological Psychology (2022)
**Week:** 3 (Affordances I)

## Key Concepts
*   **Affordances:** Opportunities for behavior. The primary content of perception (e.g., "sit-on-able", "climb-able").
*   **Relational Property:** Affordances exist in the relation between animal and environment (like friction). Neither objective (physical) nor subjective (mental).
*   **Body-Scaling:** Affordances are scaled to the animal's body (e.g., leg length, arm length).
*   **Action-Scaling:** Affordances are scaled to the animal's dynamic abilities (e.g., energy cost, strength).
*   **Critical $\pi$ (Pi) Values:** The dimensionless ratio (e.g., $R/L = 0.88$) determining the boundary between possible and impossible actions.
*   **Warren (1984) Stair Study:** The paradigmatic study showing stair climbability is perceived based on leg length ($R/L$).
*   **Optimal vs. Critical:** We perceive the *limit* (critical point) and the *most efficient* (optimal point) action.

## Summary
This chapter defines the central concept of Ecological Psychology: **Affordances**.
*   **Definition:** "Activity-specific meanings of the environment."
*   **Ontology:** Rejects the Primary/Secondary quality distinction. Affordances are real, but relative.
*   **The Warren (1984) Study:** Detailed breakdown of the stair climbing experiment.
    *   Tall vs. Short people have different absolute boundaries (cm).
    *   But they have the *same* relational boundary ($R/L \approx 0.88$).
    *   They also perceive the *optimal* step height (min energy) accurately.
*   **Extensions:**
    *   **Gap Crossing:** Scaled to leg length.
    *   **Reaching:** Scaled to arm length (and comfort).
    *   **Fitting:** Scaled to shoulder width (and compressibility).
    *   **Sitting:** Scaled to leg height.
*   **Perception of Affordances:** Direct detection of information. No calculation of "Leg Length" vs "Step Height" required. The ratio is specified in the array.

## Critical Quotes
*   "Affordances are what an animal can (or could) do in a particular circumstance, given the fit between its action capabilities and environmental properties."
*   "Affordances are a bit like friction... friction is not a property of either surface. Rather, it emerges from a relationship between them."
*   "Perceiving an affordance does not require independently perceiving the properties of the animal or the environment... Affordances are perceived in and of themselves."
*   "Warren found... the perceived critical $\pi$ value was identical to the critical $\pi$ predicted by the biomechanical model."

## Connection to Course
*   **Week 3 Activity:** The "Great Stair Lab" is a direct replication of the Warren (1984) study described here.
*   **Key Concept:** Introduces the dimensionless number ($\pi$ number) concept essential for the field trip data analysis.
