# Literature Note: Gibson (1979) - Chapter 8
**Title:** The Theory of Affordances
**Source:** The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception (1979)
**Week:** 3 (Affordances I)

## Key Concepts
*   **Affordance:** The functional utility of an object or surface for an animal (e.g., support, shelter, tool).
*   **Animal-Relative:** Affordances are neither objective (physical) nor subjective (mental); they cut across this dichotomy. They are real but measured relative to the animal (e.g., "knee-high").
*   **The Niche:** The set of affordances available to a species (how it lives), distinct from the "habitat" (where it lives).
*   **Invariant:** Affordances do not change as the observer's needs change. They are permanent possibilities.
*   **Misperception:** Affordances can be misperceived (e.g., a glass door looks like an open doorway), but the affordance itself (pass-through-ability) is an objective fact of the glass/animal relation.
*   **Social Affordances:** Other animals afford behavior (mating, fighting, nurturing). Behavior itself affords behavior.

## Summary
In this seminal chapter, Gibson formally introduces the concept of **Affordances**.
*   He defines the environment not in terms of physics (atoms, meters) but in terms of *values* and *meanings* for the animal.
*   **Surfaces:** Horizontal/rigid/extended surfaces afford *support* (ground). Vertical surfaces afford *barriers* or *climbing*.
*   **Objects:** Detached objects afford *grasping*, *throwing*, or *tool use*.
*   **Substances:** Water affords *drinking* or *washing*.
*   **The "Postbox" Example:** Critiques Koffka's "demand character" and Lewin's "valence." These were phenomenal (subjective) concepts. Gibson argues affordances are physical/ecological realities. A postbox affords mailing a letter whether you want to mail one or not.
*   **Information:** Affordances are perceived by detecting invariants in the ambient light (not by inferring utility from neutral sensory data).

## Critical Quotes
*   "The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill."
*   "An affordance is not bestowed upon an object by a need of an observer and his act of perceiving it. The object offers what it does because it is what it is."
*   "The echological niche of an organism depends on its way of life... The niche implies a kind of animal, and the animal implies a kind of niche."
*   "Behavior affords behavior... sexual behavior, nurturing behavior, fighting behavior... depend on the perceiving of what another person or other animal affords."

## Connection to Course
*   **Week 3:** This is the foundational text for the week. The "Great Stair Lab" is a direct application of the concept that affordances are measured relative to the animal ($R/L$) rather than in absolute units.
*   **Philosophy:** Sets up the rejection of the "Value-Free" world of physics.
