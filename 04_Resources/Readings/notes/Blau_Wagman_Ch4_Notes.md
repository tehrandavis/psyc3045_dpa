# Lecture Notes: Blau & Wagman Chapter 4
## "What Is Ecological Theory?"

**Core Theme:** Tools for a New Science
**Goal:** Provide the "Guiding Intuitions" for how to do psychology without a Central Executive.

## 1. Not Machines, But Systems
*   **The Old Metaphor:** The Body as a Machine.
    *   Parts are independent (you can swap a tire).
    *   Linear causality (A pushes B).
*   **The New Metaphor:** The Organism as a System.
    *   Parts are interdependent (heart transplant rejection).
    *   **Metronomes on a Board:** The synchronization emerges from the *coupling*, not the metronomes themselves.
    *   **Implication:** We must study the *interaction*, not just the components.

## 2. Measuring Directly (The Polar Planimeter)
*   **The Problem:** How do we measure a complex property (like Area) without computing it from simple properties (Length/Width)?
*   **The Metaphor:** **The Polar Planimeter** (Amsler, 1854).
    *   A mechanical tool with a wheel and an arm.
    *   You trace the perimeter. The wheel rolls. The dial shows the **Area**.
    *   **Crucial Insight:** The device *cannot* measure length or width. It is "dumb" about the lower-order variables, but "smart" about the higher-order variable.
*   **Application to Perception:**
    *   We are Polar Planimeters.
    *   We don't measure "Distance" (lower-order) and calculate "Time."
    *   We detect "Tau" (higher-order) directly.
    *   **Runeson's Principle:** "Smart instruments" capitalize on natural laws to bypass computation.

## 3. Self-Organization (No Conductor)
*   **The Orchestra without a Conductor:**
    *   Dr. Pick (Central Executive) is sick.
    *   The musicians listen to each other (Local Coupling).
    *   Music (Global Order) emerges.
*   **Implication:** Complex behavior does not require a complex commander. It requires **Constraints** and **Coupling**.

## 4. Hume's Touchstone (Anti-Humanism)
*   **The Rule:** "If a theory explains human behavior, it must also apply to animals doing the same behavior."
*   **The Test:** Humans catch balls. Dogs catch frisbees.
    *   If your theory requires "Human Intelligence/Math," it fails the Dog Test.
    *   We need a theory based on **Lawful Information** available to both.

## 5. Non-Local / Circular Causality
*   **Linear:** Billiard balls. A -> B -> C.
*   **Circular:** Perception -> Action -> Perception.
*   **The "Legs of a Table":** Causality is supporting constraints, not just a single "push."
