**Title:** Ecological Optics and Visual Perception—Getting Light Into the Muscles
**Source:** Introduction to Ecological Psychology (2022)
**Week:** 2 (Direct Perception & Optic Flow)

## Key Concepts
*   **Ecological Optics:** The study of light at the macro scale (illuminating surfaces) rather than micro scale (photons).
*   **Ambient Optic Array:** The structured arrangement of light angles reaching a point of observation. Unique to every point.
*   **Radiant vs. Ambient Light:** We see *reflected* (ambient) light, not *radiant* source light. Light itself is invisible.
*   **Texture Gradient:** Information about surface layout (slant/tilt).
*   **Occlusion:** Information about depth order (one surface hiding another).
*   **Optic Flow:** The *transformation* of the optic array caused by movement.
    *   **Global Flow:** Self-movement (expansion = forward, contraction = backward).
    *   **Local Flow:** Object movement.
*   **Tau ($\tau$):** Time-to-contact variable. $\tau = 1 / \text{rate of expansion}$.
*   **Outfielders/Dogs:** Use Optical Acceleration Cancellation (OAC) or Linear Optical Trajectory (LOT) to catch objects.

## Summary
This chapter details **how** visual information works without images.
*   **No Image:** The retina is not a screen. Light provides information about *surfaces* and *events*.
*   **Structure:** Light is structured by the environment (reflection, absorption, scatter).
*   **Information for Layout:** Texture gradients specify ground planes. Occlusion specifies edges.
*   **Information for Movement (Self):** Global flow specifies ego-motion (walking, flying).
*   **Information for Movement (Objects):** Local flow specifies object motion.
    *   **Looming:** Symmetric expansion = collision.
    *   **Tau:** The rate of expansion specifies *when* collision will occur (gannets diving, flies landing).
*   **The Catching Problem:** Fred/Dogs/Outfielders catch balls by moving to straighten the optical trajectory (LOT) or cancel optical acceleration (OAC). No calculus required.

## Critical Quotes
*   "The question posed by the ecological approach is instead the one made famous by Michael Turvey—'How does light get into the muscles?'"
*   "Light, as such, is not visible. We never see light. We see illuminated surfaces."
*   "The optic flow pattern encountered by an animal is not just body-scaled—it is also action-scaled."
*   "Rather than calculating anything... a person may only need to... follow two simple rules... Move so that the ball appears to be traveling a straight-line path."

## Connection to Course
*   **Week 2 Activity:** "Visualizing Tau" is directly explained here. The derivation of Tau is covered.
*   **Week 1 Activity:** The "Robot vs Outfielder" debate relies on the LOT/OAC strategies described in the "Two Simple Rules" section.
