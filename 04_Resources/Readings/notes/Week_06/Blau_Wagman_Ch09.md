# Literature Note: Blau & Wagman (2022) - Chapter 9
**Title:** Action and Coordination
**Source:** Introduction to Ecological Psychology (2022)
**Week:** 6 (Coordination Dynamics)

## Key Concepts
*   **The Bernstein Problem:** The Degrees of Freedom (DOF) problem. How to control 600+ muscles/joints?
*   **Context-Conditioned Variability:** The relationship between muscle activity and movement changes based on context (gravity, velocity).
*   **Synergies:** Functional groupings of muscles/joints that act as a single unit (e.g., "Harmonizing choir of muscles").
*   **Freezing vs. Freeing:** Novices freeze DOFs (rigid); Experts free DOFs (exploit reactive forces).
*   **Repetition Without Repetition:** Achieving the same goal (hammering) via different movements every time.
*   **Self-Organization:** Coordination emerges from local rules, not central commands.
*   **HKB Model:** The Haken-Kelso-Bunz model of phase transitions.
    *   **In-Phase:** Stable at all speeds.
    *   **Anti-Phase:** Unstable at high speeds.
    *   **Phase Transition:** Spontaneous switch from anti- to in-phase.

## Summary
This chapter moves from perception to **Action**.
*   **Critique of Motor Programs:** The "Central Executive" cannot control every joint (too many DOFs, context variability).
*   **The Solution:** Synergies. The brain controls parameters (like "stiffness" or "tempo"), and the muscles self-organize.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Blacksmiths:** Hammer trajectory is consistent; arm trajectory varies.
    *   **Speech:** Perturbing the jaw causes instant compensation in the *lips* (functional synergy).
*   **Postural Sway:** Standing is "controlled falling." Sway supports perception (looking, wielding).
*   **Coordination Dynamics (HKB):** Finger wagging experiments.
    *   Demonstrates nonlinear changes (phase transitions) driven by a control parameter (speed).
    *   Shows that stability (attractors) governs movement, not programs.
*   **Gait:** Walking $\rightarrow$ Running is a phase transition.

## Critical Quotes
*   "Moving in a coordinated way requires transforming the forces that are given for free into the forces that are needed."
*   "Performing a coordinated goal-directed behavior is as much—or more—about 'freezing out' or 'clamping down' on unnecessary degrees of freedom."
*   "The purpose of synergy is not to produce a movement but rather to achieve a goal."
*   "Repetition without repetition... performing a skilled movement... is about using slightly different movement patterns across slightly different contexts."

## Connection to Course
*   **Week 6 Activity:** "Finger Wiggling Phase Transition" is the HKB experiment described here.
*   **Week 7 Activity:** "Frozen Limb Challenge" is based on the Freezing/Freeing DOFs section.
