# Literature Note: Blau & Wagman (2022) - Chapter 16
**Title:** Self-Organization
**Source:** Introduction to Ecological Psychology (2022)
**Week:** 6 (Coordination Dynamics)

## Key Concepts
*   **Self-Organization:** Order arising from local interactions without a central leader/blueprint.
*   **Rayleigh-Bénard Convection:** Oil molecules organizing into hexagons when heated.
*   **Emergence:** Macro-level patterns (swirls, flocks) created by micro-level rules.
*   **Multistability:** System can be in more than one stable state (clockwise or counter-clockwise swirl).
*   **Circular Causality:** The parts create the whole; the whole constrains the parts.
*   **Examples:** Termite mounds, Firefly flashing, Heart beating, Traffic jams.

## Summary
This chapter expands on **Self-Organization** as the alternative to the Central Executive.
*   **The Orchestra:** Can play without a conductor if players listen to neighbors (local rules).
*   **Ants/Termites:** Build complex structures using "Stigmergy" (leaving chemical trails). No ant has the blueprint.
*   **Fireflies:** Synchronize flashing not by a "go" signal, but by resetting their timer when they see a neighbor flash.
*   **Slime Molds:** Single cells congregate into a multicellular slug/plant when hungry.
*   **The Heart:** Heart cells beat independently; when touching, they sync up.
*   **Why?** Self-organization is robust, flexible, and requires less "work" from a designer (evolution).
*   **Robotics:** Swarm robots can build houses by following simple rules (place block next to block).

## Critical Quotes
*   "No one is in charge, and yet everyone is."
*   "A self-organized system is one in which small, minimally intelligent pieces follow local, simple rules... and from this, patterns spontaneously emerge."
*   "There is no gene that codes for synchronization; synchronization is a by-product... a gift with purchase."
*   "The convection cell cannot be seen by viewing a single oil molecule."

## Connection to Course
*   **Week 6:** Provides the theoretical mechanism for the HKB phase transition.
*   **Week 11/12:** Supports the "Neural Population" ideas (brain as self-organizing).
