# Literature Note: Blau & Wagman (2022) - Chapter 13
**Title:** Applications of Ecological Psychology
**Source:** Introduction to Ecological Psychology (2022)
**Week:** 13 (Human-Machine Teaming / Applications)

## Key Concepts
*   **Ecological Interface Design (EID):** Designing displays/tools to make affordances visible (direct perception) rather than requiring calculation.
*   **Nudging:** Using environmental design to encourage behavior (e.g., lines on the road to slow drivers).
*   **Rehabilitation:** Focusing on the *task/goal* (person-environment fit) rather than isolated muscle movement.
*   **Prosthetics:** Using sensory substitution or haptic feedback (time-to-break) to enable direct control.
*   **The "End of Sitting":** Designing offices with varied affordances for standing/leaning to promote movement.
*   **Mental Health:** Viewed as a change in the "Field of Affordances" (e.g., Depression = flattened field; OCD = one dominant compulsion).

## Summary
This chapter shows how to **use** the theory to solve real-world problems.
*   **Traffic Safety:** Lake Shore Drive example. Painting lines closer together creates *global optical expansion* (illusion of speed), forcing drivers to slow down naturally.
*   **Architecture:** Rietveld's "End of Sitting." Designing offices that afford multiple postures.
*   **EID (Cockpits):** Instead of dials (altitude, speed), show *invariants* (splay lines, time-to-contact) so flying is like a video game.
*   **Surgery:** Haptic feedback in simulators helps surgeons feel "distance-to-break" of tissue.
*   **Disability/Rehab:**
    *   **Stroke:** Patients don't misperceive apertures; they fail to *rotate shoulders* enough. Rehab should practice the whole action.
    *   **Prosthetics:** "Myogames" only work if they simulate the actual perception-action loop (catching), not abstract muscle flexing.
*   **Mental Health:** Depression is a "landscape of affordances" where nothing looks inviting ("solicitations" are gone).

## Critical Quotes
*   "A theory is only as good as the practical problems it can help to solve!"
*   "If you want drivers to slow down... provide information about their current movement speed that compels them to slow down without any conscious thought."
*   "Designing displays or devices that support direct perception is the focus of ecological interface design (EID)."
*   "For people with depression, it may be that the field of affordances is narrower... The person may feel as if very few affordances are available."

## Connection to Course
*   **Week 13 Activity:** "Trust Fall with a Robot" utilizes EID principles.
*   **Week 10 Activity:** "Tech Affordance Audit" connects to the design principles here.
*   **Consultant's Report:** This chapter is the "manual" for the final project.
