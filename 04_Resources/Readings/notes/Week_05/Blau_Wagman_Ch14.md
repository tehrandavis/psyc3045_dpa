# Literature Note: Blau & Wagman (2022) - Chapter 14
**Title:** Dynamical Systems
**Source:** Introduction to Ecological Psychology (2022)
**Week:** 5 (Dynamical Systems 101)

## Key Concepts
*   **Nonlinear Causality:** Small changes can cause huge effects (The Butterfly Effect). The whole $\neq$ sum of parts.
*   **Attractor Layout (Landscape):** The map of all possible states.
    *   **Attractor:** A stable state the system "wants" to go to (deep valley).
    *   **Repeller:** Unstable state (hilltop).
    *   **Basin of Attraction:** The area leading to an attractor.
*   **Control Parameter:** The variable that changes the layout (e.g., speed, temperature).
*   **Phase Transition:** Discontinuous shift from one attractor to another (Walk $\rightarrow$ Run).
*   **Hysteresis:** History dependence. The system "remembers" where it was (it stays in a pattern longer than expected).
*   **Self-Organization:** Order arising from component interactions (convection cells, sheet game).

## Summary
This chapter introduces the math and metaphors of **Complexity**.
*   **The Sheet Game:** Metaphor for an attractor. Rolling a ball on a sheet. Forming a "basin" makes the ball go to the center without steering it.
*   **HKB Model (Finger Wiggling):
    *   At slow speeds, 2 attractors (In-Phase, Anti-Phase).
    *   As speed (Control Parameter) increases, the Anti-Phase attractor disappears (death of an attractor).
    *   The system falls into In-Phase.
    *   **Hysteresis:** Slowing down does not immediately bring Anti-Phase back.
*   **Learning:** Creating a new attractor (juggling).
*   **Adaptation:** Moving an attractor (prism glasses).
*   **Noise:** Not error! Noise is essential for flexibility (finding new attractors).
*   **A-Not-B Error:** Reinterpreted not as "lack of object permanence" but as a "deep attractor" created by repetitive reaching to location A.

## Critical Quotes
*   "Behavior is an emergent phenomenon, not the sum of the parts."
*   "You don't 'decide' to sleep at 2 AM; your system settles there."
*   "Slow and continuous changes to a system can bring about fast and discontinuous reorganization."
*   "Noise is what keeps us from getting stuck in one particular attractor; it allows for flexibility."

## Connection to Course
*   **Week 5 Activity:** "Mapping Your Attractors" is purely based on this chapter's metaphors.
*   **Week 6 Activity:** The Finger Wiggling lab is the HKB model described here.
