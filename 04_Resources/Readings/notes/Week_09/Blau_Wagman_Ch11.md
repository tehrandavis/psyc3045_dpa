# Literature Note: Blau & Wagman (2022) - Chapter 11
**Title:** Perceiving and Acting With Others—an Ecological Social Psychology
**Source:** Introduction to Ecological Psychology (2022)
**Week:** 9 (Social Coordination)

## Key Concepts
*   **Social Affordances:** Affordances for others (e.g., "Can he reach that?") and for joint action (e.g., "Can *we* lift that?").
*   **Interpersonal Synergies:** Two people acting as one functional unit (e.g., carrying a table, walking together).
*   **Unintentional Coordination:** Spontaneous synchronization (entrainment) between people (rocking chairs, walking).
*   **Visual Coupling:** Seeing another person creates a coupling force (like a mechanical spring) leading to sync.
*   **Joint Action:**
    *   **Passability:** Doorway width for *two* people is less than the sum of individuals (shared space).
    *   **Plank Lifting:** The transition to "two-person lifting" is action-scaled (critical $\pi$ value).
*   **Mirror Neurons (Ecological Take):** Resonance, not simulation.

## Summary
This chapter extends ecological principles to **Social Interaction**.
*   **Perceiving for Others:** We perceive affordances for others (e.g., reaching height) using the same kinematics (motion info) we use for ourselves. Basketball players are better at perceiving jumping affordances for others.
*   **Acting Together (Interpersonal Synergy):**
    *   **Rocking Chairs:** People spontaneously synchronize if they can see each other (visual coupling).
    *   **Walking:** Pairs fall into "gaits" (pace vs trot) like a four-legged animal.
*   **Affordances for "We":**
    *   **Plank Moving:** People switch to "joint carrying" at a lawful ratio of plank length to arm span.
    *   **Doorway Passing:** Couples "share" space; aperture crossing is an emergent property of the dyad.
*   **Sports:** Kendo fighters and Rugby players perceive interpersonal affordances (openings, distance to strike).

## Critical Quotes
*   "The very same lawful principles that underlie perceiving and acting in animal-environment systems also do so in animal-animal-environment systems."
*   "Affordances are neither in the animal nor in the environment but emerge only in the relationship between the two... [Social affordances] emerge in the relationship between animal and animal."
*   "Despite the instruction to rock at their own preferred tempos, they couldn’t help but rock in sync with the other person."
*   "Two or more animals perceiving and acting together create social (or interpersonal) synergy."

## Connection to Course
*   **Week 9 Activity:** "The Unintentional Sync" is the rocking chair/walking experiment described here.
*   **Case Studies:** Strong theoretical basis for social/team dynamics projects.
