# Week 3 Plan: The Axioms & Ecological Optics

## 🗓️ Context
*   **Date:** Jan 27 (Tue) & Jan 29 (Thu)
*   **Theme:** "Starting Over" — Establishing the Axioms of Ecological Psychology and transitioning to the geometry of information (Optics).
*   **Readings (Due Tue):** Blau & Wagman Ch 3-4 (The Axioms / Polar Planimeter).

---

## 🟢 Tuesday (Jan 27): The Setup
**Goal:** Solidify the "Ecological Realism" stance and foreshadow how light carries information.

### 1. Review & Discussion (The Axioms)
*   **The Pivot:** Recap the "Computer vs. Organism" (Homunculus problem).
*   **Blau & Wagman Ch 3 (The 9 Assumptions):**
    *   *Realism:* The world is real and we are in it.
    *   *Direct Perception:* No inference, no guessing.
    *   *Animal-Environment System:* The "Niche" concept.
*   **Blau & Wagman Ch 4 (The Metaphor):**
    *   **The Polar Planimeter:** A "dumb" tool that measures complex properties (area) directly via simple mechanics.
    *   *Discuss:* How is a human like a planimeter? (We measure "time-to-contact" without calculating "time" or "distance").

### 2. Foreshadowing (Ecological Optics)
*   **The Problem:** If we don't calculate, how do we know?
*   **Intuition Pump:** "The Ambient Optic Array."
    *   Contrast *Radiant Light* (physics) vs. *Ambient Light* (ecology).
    *   *Tease:* "On Thursday, we're going to see how moving your head creates a structure in the light that specifies exactly where you are."

## 🔵 Thursday (Jan 29): The Payoff
**Goal:** Experience the "Ambient Optic Array" and define it formally.

### 1. Interactive Demo: "The Structure of Light"
*   **Activity:** Ecological Optics visualization (or "Looming" / Tau demo).
*   *Concept:* Show how **Optic Flow** (expansion/contraction) specifies movement.
*   *Key Insight:* The information is *outside* the head, in the array.

### 2. Deep Dive Lecture
*   **Topic:** Ecological Optics vs. Geometric Optics.
*   *Key Terms:* Ambient Optic Array, Occlusion, Global Flow vs. Local Flow.
*   *Connection:* Connect back to the "Poverty of the Stimulus" — the stimulus is actually **rich** if you move.

## ⏭️ Loop to Next Tuesday (Feb 3)
*   **Readings:** Blau & Wagman Ch 6 (Ecological Optics) + Gibson Ch 1.
*   **Topic:** Formalizing Tau and the visual control of action.
